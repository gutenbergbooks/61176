<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The following work was written several years since, simply as an
historical study, and with little expectation of its publication. Recent
movements in several portions of the great Christian Church seem to
indicate, however, that a record of ascetic celibacy, as developed in
the past, may not be without interest to those who are watching the
tendencies of the present.</p>

<p>So far as I am aware, no work of the kind exists in English
literature, and those which have appeared in the Continental languages
are almost exclusively of a controversial character. It has
been my aim to avoid polemics, and I have therefore sought merely
to state facts as I have found them, without regard to their bearing
on either side of the questions involved. As those questions have
long been the subject of ardent disputation, it has seemed proper to
substantiate every statement with a reference to its authority.</p>

<p>The scope of the work is designedly confined to the enforced celibacy
of the sacerdotal class. The vast history of monachism has
therefore only been touched upon incidentally when it served to
throw light upon the rise and progress of religious asceticism. The
various celibate communities which have arisen in this country, such
as the Dunkers and Shakers, are likewise excluded from the plan of
the volume. These limitations occasion me less regret since the
appearance of M. de Montalembert’s “Monks of the West” and
Mr. W. Hepworth Dixon’s “New America,” in which the student
will probably find all that he may require on these subjects.</p>

<p>Besides the controversial importance of the questions connected
with Christian asceticism, it has seemed to me that a brief history
like the present might perhaps possess interest for the general reader,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
not only on account of the influence which ecclesiastical celibacy has
exerted, directly and indirectly, on the progress of civilization, but
also from the occasional glimpse into the interior life of past ages
afforded in reviewing the effect upon society of the policy of the
church as respects the relations of the sexes. The more ambitious
historian, in detailing the intrigues of the court and the vicissitudes
of the field, must of necessity neglect the minuter incidents which
illustrate the habits, the morals, and the modes of thought of bygone
generations. From such materials a monograph like this is constructed,
and it may not be unworthy the attention of those who
deem that the life of nations does not consist exclusively of political
revolutions and military achievements.</p>

<p>In reprinting this work such changes have been made as further
reading and reflection have seemed to render advisable. The first
two and the last sections have been wholly rewritten, and numerous
additions have been made throughout the volume. To accommodate
as far as possible the considerable amount of matter thus introduced,
I have omitted from the footnotes all extracts which merely verified
without illustrating the text.</p>

<h2 id="SACERDOTAL_CELIBACY">SACERDOTAL CELIBACY.</h2>


<p>The Latin church is the great fact which dominates the history of
modern civilization. All other agencies which moulded the destinies
of mediæval Europe were comparatively isolated or sporadic in their
manifestations. Thus in one place we may trace the beneficent influence
of commerce at work, in another the turbulent energy of the
rising Third Estate; the mortal contests of the feudal powers with
each other and with progress are waged in detached and convulsive
struggles; chivalry casts only occasional and evanescent flashes of
light amid the darkness of military barbarism; literature seeks to
gain support from any power which will condescend to lend transitory
aid to the plaything of the moment. Nowhere do we see
combined effort, nowhere can we detect a pervading impulse, irrespective
of locality or of circumstance, save in the imposing machinery
of the church establishment. This meets us at every point,
and in every age, and in every sphere of action. In the dim solitude
of the cloister, the monk is training the minds which are to
mould the destinies of the period, while his roof is the refuge of
the desolate and the home of the stranger. In the tribunal, the
priest is wrestling with the baron, and is extending his more humane
and equitable code over a jurisdiction subjected to the caprices of
feudal or customary law, as applied by a class of ignorant and arbitrary
tyrants. In the royal palace, the hand of the ecclesiastic,
visible or invisible, is guiding the helm of state, regulating the
policy of nations, and converting the brute force of chivalry into the
supple instrument of his will. In Central Europe, lordly prelates,
with the temporal power and possessions of the highest princes, joined
to the exclusive pretensions of the church, make war and peace, and
are sovereign in all but name, owing no allegiance save to Emperors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
whom they elect and Popes whose cause they share. Far above all,
the successor of St. Peter from his pontifical throne claims the whole
of Europe as his empire, and dictates terms to kings who crouch
under his reproof, or are crushed in the vain effort of rebellion. At
the other extremity of society, the humble minister of the altar, with
his delegated power over heaven and hell, wields in cottage as in
castle an authority hardly less potent, and sways the minds of the
faithful with his right to implicit obedience. Even art offers a
willing submission to the universal mistress, and seeks the embodiment
of its noblest aspirations in the lofty poise of the cathedral
spire, the rainbow glories of the painted window, and the stately
rhythm of the solemn chant.</p>

<p>This vast fabric of ecclesiastical supremacy presents one of the
most curious problems which the world’s history affords. A wide
and absolute authority, deriving its force from moral power alone,
marshalling no legions of its own in battle array, but permeating
everything with its influence, walking unarmed through deadly strife,
rising with renewed strength from every prostration, triumphing alike
over the savage nature of the barbarian and the enervated apathy of
the Roman tributary, blending discordant races and jarring nations
into one great brotherhood of subjection—such was the Papal hierarchy,
a marvel and a mystery. Well is it personified in Gregory
VII., a fugitive from Rome, without a rood of ground to call him
master, a rival Pope lording it in the Vatican, a triumphant Emperor
vowed to internecine strife, yet issuing his commands as sternly and
as proudly to prince and potentate as though he were the unquestioned
suzerain of Europe, and listened to as humbly by three-fourths of
Christendom. The man wasted away in the struggle; his death was
but the accident of time: the church lived on, and marched to inevitable
victory.</p>

<p>The investigations of the curious can hardly be deemed misapplied
in analyzing the elements of this impalpable but irresistible power,
and in examining the causes which have enabled it to preserve such
unity of action amid such diversity of environment, presenting everywhere
by turns a solid and united front to the opposing influences of
barbarism and civilization. In detaching one of these elements from
the group, and tracing out its successive vicissitudes, I may therefore
be pardoned for thinking the subject of sufficient interest to warrant
a minuteness of detail that would otherwise perhaps appear disproportionate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p>The Janizaries of the Porte were Christian children, recruited by
the most degrading tribute which tyrannical ingenuity has invented.
Torn from their homes in infancy, every tie severed that bound them
to the world around them; the past a blank, the future dependent
solely upon the master above them; existence limited to the circle of
their comrades, among whom they could rise, but whom they could
never leave; such was the corps which bore down the bravest of the
Christian chivalry and carried the standard of the Prophet in triumph
to the walls of Vienna. Mastering at length their master, they
wrung from him the privilege of marriage; and the class in becoming
hereditary, with human hopes and fears disconnected with the one
idea of their service, no longer presented the same invincible phalanx,
and at last became terrible only to the effeminate denizens of the
seraglio. The example is instructive, and it affords grounds for the
assumption that the canon which bound all the active ministers of
the church to perpetual celibacy, and thus created an impassable
barrier between them and the outer world, was one of the efficient
instruments in creating and consolidating both the temporal and
spiritual power of the Roman hierarchy.</p>

<h2><a name="I" id="I">I.</a><br />

ASCETICISM.</h2>


<p>The most striking contrast between the Mosaic Dispensation and
the Law of Christ is the materialism of the one, and the pure spiritualism
of the other. The Hebrew prophet threatens worldly punishments,
and promises fleshly rewards: the Son of Man teaches us to
contemn the treasures of this life, and directs all our fears and aspirations
towards eternity. The exaggeration of these teachings by the
zeal of fervent disciples led to the ascetic efforts to subjugate nature,
which present so curious a feature in religious history, and of which
those concerning the relations of the sexes form the subject of our
consideration.</p>

<p>This special phase of asceticism was altogether foreign to the traditions
of Israel, averse as they were to all restrictions upon the full
physical development of man. Enjoying, apparently, no conception
of a future existence, the earlier Hebrews had no incentive to sacrifice
the pleasures of the world for those of a Heaven of which they
knew nothing; nor was the gross polytheism, which the monotheistic
prophets combated, of a nature to lead to ascetic practices. The
worship of Ashera—probably identical with the Babylonian Beltis or
Mylitta—undoubtedly consecrated the sacrifice of chastity as a religious
rite, and those who revered the goddess of fertility as one of the
supreme deities were not likely to impose any restrictions on the exercise
of her powers.<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> We see, indeed, in the story of Judah and Tamar,
and in the lamentation of the daughter of Jephthah, that virginity
was regarded almost as a disgrace, and that child-bearing was considered
the noblest function of woman; while the institution of levirate
marriage shows an importance attributed to descendants in the male<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
line as marked as among the Hindu Arya. The hereditary character
of the priesthood, moreover, both as vested in the original Levites, and
the later Tsadukim and Baithusin, indicates conclusively that even
among the orthodox no special sanctity attached to continence, and that
the temporary abstinence from women required of those who handled
the hallowed articles of the altar (<i>I. Samuel xxi. 4-5</i>) was simply a
distinction drawn between the sacerdotal class and the laity, for in the
elaborate instructions as to uncleanness, there is no allusion made to
sexual indulgence, though the priest who had partaken of wine was
forbidden to enter the Tabernacle, and defilement arising from contact
with the dead was a disability (<i>Levit. x., xxi., xxii.</i>),<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> while the highest
blessing that could be promised as a reward for obedience to God
was that “there shall not be male or female barren among you”
(<i>Deut. vii. 14</i>). In fact, the only manifestation of asceticism as a religious
ordinance, prior to the Second Temple, is seen in the vow of
the Nazirites, which consisted merely in allowing the hair to remain
unshorn, in the abstinence from wine and in avoiding the pollution
arising from contact with the dead. Slender as were these restrictions,
the ordinary term of a Nazirate was only thirty days, though
it might be assumed for life, as in the cases of Samson and Samuel;
and the vows for long terms were deemed sufficiently pleasing to God
to serve as means of propitiation, as in the case of Hannah, who thus
secured her offspring Samuel, and in that of Helena, Queen of Adiabene,
who vowed a Nazirate of seven years if her son Izaces should
return in safety from a campaign.<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The few references to the custom
in Scripture, however, show that it was little used, and that it exercised
no visible influence over social life during the earlier periods.</p>

<p>When the conquests of Cyrus released the Hebrews from captivity,
the close relations established with the Persians wrought no change
in this aspect of the Jewish faith. Mazdeism, in fact, was a religion
so wholesome and practical in its character that asceticism could find
little place among its prescribed observances, and the strict maintenance
of its priesthood in certain families who transmitted their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
sacred lore from father to son, shows that no restrictions were placed
upon the ministers of Hormadz, or athravas,<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> though in the later
period of the Achæmenian empire, after the purity of ancient Mazdeism
had become corrupted, the priestesses of the Sun were required
to observe chastity, without necessarily being virgins.<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> With the conquests
of Alexander, however, Judaism was exposed to new influences,
and was brought into relation at once with Grecian thought and with
the subtle mysticism of India, with which intercourse became frequent
under the Greek empire. Beyond the Indus the Sankhya philosophy
was already venerable, which taught the nothingness of life, and that
the supreme good consisted in the absolute victory over all human
wants and desires.<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Already Buddha had reduced this philosophy
into a system of religion, the professors of which were bound to
chastity—a rule impossible of observance by the world at large, but
which became obligatory upon its innumerable priests and monks,
when it spread and established itself as a church, thus furnishing the
prototype which was subsequently copied by Roman Christianity.<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
Already Brahmanism had invented the classes of Vanaprasthas,
Sannyasis, and others—ascetics whose practices of self-mortification
anticipated and excelled all that is related of Christian Antonys and
Simeons—although the ancestor worship which required every man
to provide descendants who should keep alive the Sraddha in honor of
the Pitris of his forefathers postponed the entrance into the life of
the anchorite until after he should have fulfilled his parental duties:<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
and we know from the references in the Greek writers to the Hindu
gymnosophists how great an impression these customs had made upon
those to whom they were a novelty.<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> Already the Yoga system had
been framed, whereby absorption into the Godhead was to be obtained
by religious mendicancy, penances, mortifications, and the severest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
severance of self from all external surroundings.<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> All this had been
founded on the primæval doctrine of the Vedas with respect to the
virtue of <i>Tapas</i>, or austere religious abstraction, to which the most
extravagant powers were attributed, conferring upon its votaries the
authority of gods.<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> With all the absurdities of these beliefs and
practices, they yet sprang from a profound conviction of the superiority
of the spiritual side of man’s nature, and if their theory of
the nothingness of mortal existence was exaggerated, yet they tended
to elevate the soul, at the expense, it must be confessed, of a regard
to the duties which man owes to society.</p>

<p>The influences arising from this system of religious philosophy, so
novel to the Semitic races, were tardy is making themselves felt upon
the Hebrews, but they became gradually apparent. The doctrine of
a future life with rewards and punishments, doubtless derived from
Chaldean and Mazdean sources during the Captivity and under the
Persian Empire, slowly made its way, and though opposed by the
aristocratic conservative party in power—the Tsadukim or Sadducees
(descendants of Zadoc, or just men)—it became one of the distinctive
dogmas of the Beth Sopherim or House of Scribes, composed of religious
teachers, trained in all the learning of the day, sprung from
the people, and eager to maintain their nationality against the temporizing
policy of their rulers.<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> At the breaking out of the Maccabean
revolt against Antiochus Epiphanes we find the nation divided
into two factions, the Sadducees, disposed rather to submit to the
Hellenizing tyranny of Antioch, and the Chassidim (the Assideans of
the Authorized Version), democratic reformers, ready for innovation
and prepared to die in defence of their faith. In the triumph of
the Hasmonean revolution they obtained control of the state, and
in the development of the Oral Law by the scribes, supplementing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
the Torah or Written Law, they engrafted permanently their doctrines
upon the ancestral belief. With the tenet of spiritual immortality,
there followed as a necessary consequence the subordination of
the present existence to life hereafter, which is the direct incentive to
asceticism. The religious exaltation of the stormy period which intervened
between the liberation from Antioch and the subjugation to
Rome afforded a favorable soil for the growth of this tendency, and
rendered the minds of the devout accessible to the influences both of
Eastern and of Western speculation. How powerful eventually
became the latter upon the Alexandrian Jews may be estimated from
the mysticism of Philo.</p>

<p>With their triumph over Antioch, the name of the Chassidim disappears
as that of an organized party, and in its place we find those
of two factions or sects—the Perushim (Pharisees) or Separatists,
who maintained an active warfare, temporal and theological, with the
Sadducees, and the Essenes, mystics, who bound themselves by vows,
generally including the Nazirate, and withdrew from active life for
the benefit of spiritual growth and meditation.</p>

<p>The Essenes cultivated the soil and sometimes even lived in cities,
but often dwelt as anchorites, using no artificial textures as clothing,
and no food save what was spontaneously produced. They mostly
practised daily ablutions and admitted neophytes to their society by
the rite of baptism after a novitiate of a year, followed by two years
of probation. Among those who did not live as hermits, property
was held in common, and marriage was abstained from, and it is to
this latter practice doubtless that reference was made by Christ in
the text “There be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for
the kingdom of heaven’s sake.” The Essenes enjoyed high consideration
among the people; their teachings were listened to with
respect, and they were regarded as especially favored with the gifts
of divination and prophecy. There can be no doubt that John the
Baptist was an Essene; James of Jerusalem, brother of Jesus, was a
Nazirite and probably an Essene, and Christ himself may reasonably
be regarded as trained in the principles of the sect. His tendencies
all lay in that direction, and it is observable that while he is unsparing
in his denunciations of the Scribes, and Pharisees, and Sadducees,
he never utters a word of condemnation of the Essenes.<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>It is thus easy to understand the refined spirituality of Christ’s
teachings, and the urgency with which he called the attention of
man from the gross temptations of earth to the higher things which
should fit him for the inheritance of eternal life. Yet his profound
wisdom led him to forbear from enjoining even the asceticism of
the Essenes. He allowed a moderate enjoyment of the gifts of the
Creator; and when he sternly rebuked the Scribes and Pharisees
for imposing, in their development of the Oral Law, burdens upon
men not easily to be borne by the weakness of human nature, he
was far indeed from seeking to render obligatory, or even to recommend,
practices which only the fervor of fanaticism could render
endurable. No teacher before him had ventured to form so lofty a
conception of the marriage-tie. It was an institution of God himself
whereby man and wife became one flesh. “What therefore God hath
joined together let not man put asunder;” and though he refrained
from condemning abstention from wedlock, he regarded it as possible
only to those whose exceptional exaltation of temperament might
enable them to overcome the instincts and passions of humanity.<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>When the broad proselyting views and untiring energy of Paul,
the apostle of the Gentiles, were brought to bear upon the little
circle of mourning disciples, it was inevitable that a rupture should
take place. No one in the slightest degree familiar with the spirit
of Judaism at that day can have difficulty in understanding how
those who still regarded themselves as Jews, who looked upon their
martyr, not as the Son of God, but, in the words of Peter, as “Jesus
of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, by miracles and
wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you,” and
who held, as is urged in the Epistle of James, firmly to their Master’s
injunction to preserve every jot and tittle of the Law, should regard
with growing distrust and distaste the activity of the Pharisee Paul,
who, like other Pharisees, was ready to encompass land and sea to
gain one proselyte, and, more than this, was prepared to throw down
the exclusive barriers of the Law in order to invite all mankind to
share in the glad tidings of Salvation.<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> The division came in time,
and as the Gentile church spread and flourished, it stigmatized as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
heretics those who adhered to the simple monotheistic reformed
Judaism which Christ had taught. These became known as the
Ebionim, or Poor Men, Essenes, and others, who followed Christ as
a prophet inspired by God, who accepted all of the apostles save
Paul, whom they regarded as a transgressor of the Law, holding
their property in common, honoring virginity rather than marriage,
but uttering no precept upon the subject, and observing the Written
Law with rigid accuracy. They maintained a quiet existence for
four centuries, making no progress, but exciting no antagonism save
on the part of vituperative heresiologists, whose denunciations, however,
contain no rational grounds for regarding them otherwise than
as the successors of the original followers of Christ.<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Pauline Christianity, launched on the tumultuous existence
of the Gentile world, had adapted itself to the passions and
ambitions of men, had availed itself both of their strength and of
their weakness, and had become a very different creed from that
which had been taught around the Sea of Galilee, and had seen its
teacher expiate on Calvary his revolt against the Oral Law. In its
gradual transformation through the ages, from Essenic and Ebionic
simplicity to the magnificent sacerdotalism of the Innocents and
Gregories, it has felt itself bound to find or make, in its earliest
records, some precedent for every innovation, and accordingly its
ardent polemics in modern times have endeavored to prove that the
celibacy of its ministers was, if not absolutely ordained, at least
practised from the earliest period. Much unnecessary logic and
argument have been spent upon this subject since the demand which
arose for clerical marriage at the Reformation forced the champions
of the church to find scriptural authority for the canon which enjoins
celibacy. The fact is that prior to the sixteenth century the fathers
of the church had no scruple in admitting that in primitive times the
canon had no existence and the custom was not observed. The
reader may therefore well be spared a disquisition upon a matter which
may be held to be self-evident, and be contented with a brief reference
to some of the authorities of the church who, prior to the Reformation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
admitted that in primitive times marriage was freely permitted to the
ministers of Christ.</p>

<p>No doctor of the church did more than St. Jerome to impose the
rule of celibacy on its members, yet even he admits that at the beginning
there was no absolute injunction to that effect; and he endeavors
to apologize for the admission by arguing that infants must
be nourished with milk and not with solid food.<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> In the middle of
the eleventh century, during the controversy between Rome and Constantinople,
Rome had no scruple in admitting that the celebrated
text of St. Paul (<i>I. Cor. ix. 5</i>) meant that the apostles were married,
though subsequent commentators have exhausted so much ingenuity
in explaining it away.<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> A century later Gratian, the most learned
canonist of his time, in the “Decretum,” undertaken at the request
of the papal court, which has ever since maintained its position as
the standard of the canon law, felt no hesitation in admitting that, before
the adoption of the canon, marriage was everywhere undisturbed
among those in orders, as it continued to be in the Greek church.<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
The reputation of St. Thomas Aquinas as a theologian was as unquestioned
as that of Gratian as a canonist, and the Angelic Doctor
admitted as freely as the canon lawyer that compulsory celibacy was
an innovation on the rules of the primitive church, which he endeavors
to explain by an argument contradictory to that of St. Jerome, for
he says that the greater sanctity of the earlier Christians rendered
them superior to the asceticism requisite to the purity of a degenerate
age, even as no modern warrior could emulate the exploit of Samson
in throwing himself amid a hostile army with no other weapon than
a jaw-bone. He even admits, what other authorities have denied,
that Christ required no separation between St. Peter and his wife.<a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
There were in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries few more
learned men than Giraldus Cambrensis, whose orthodoxy was unquestioned,
and who, as Archdeacon of St. David’s, vigorously sought
to enforce the rule of continence upon his recalcitrant clergy. Yet
in a strenuous exhortation to them to mend the error of their ways
in this respect, he admits that clerical celibacy has no scriptural or
apostolic warrant.<a id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> That this was universally admitted at the time
is manifested by Alfonso the Wise, of Castile, about the middle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
the thirteenth century, asserting the fact in the most positive manner,
while forbidding marriage to the priests of his dominions, in the code
known as Las Siete Partidas.<a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>Gerson, indeed, who, like most of the ecclesiastics of his time, attributes
to the Council of Nicæa the introduction of celibacy, seems
inclined to justify the change assumed to have been then made, by
alluding to the forged donation of Constantine. That the temporalities
of the church could only be entrusted to men cut off from family
ties was an axiom in his day, and though he does not himself draw the
conclusion, he clearly regarded the supposed accession to the landed
estates of the church as a satisfactory explanation of the prohibition
of marriage to its ministers in the fourth century.<a id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Shortly afterwards,
Pius II., one of the most learned of the popes, had no scruple
in admitting that the primitive church was administered by a married
clergy.<a id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> Just before the Reformation, Geoffroi Boussard, dean of
the faculty of theology of Paris, published, in 1505, a dissertation on
priestly continence, in which he positively assumes, as the basis of
his argument, that the use of marriage was universally permitted to
those in holy orders, from the time of Christ to that of Siricius and
Innocent I.; and this may be assumed to be the opinion of the
University of Paris, for Boussard formally submitted his tract to that
body, and its approbation is to be found in the fact that he was subsequently
elevated to its chancellorship, and was sent as its delegate
to the Council of Pisa.<a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>Even after the Reformation, unexceptionable orthodox authority
is found to the same effect. In 1564, Pius IV. admitted it in an
epistle to the German princes, and explained it by the necessity of
the times.<a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Zaccaria, probably the most learned of Catholic polemics
on the subject, endeavors to reconcile his belief in the Apostolic
origin of clerical celibacy with the indubitable practice of the primitive
church, by suggesting that while the Apostles commanded the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
observance of the rule by the clergy in general, yet in special cases
they discreetly dispensed with it to avoid greater scandals; and that
with the gradual increase of these dispensations the clergy came at
length to assume the indulgence as a matter of course without asking
for special licenses.<a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> More logical is the argument brought forward
by a priest named Taillard, resisting in 1842 some efforts made to
introduce priestly marriage in Prussian Poland. He coolly reasons
that if celibacy was not enforced in the primitive church, it ought to
have been—“if the celibacy of the priesthood be not from the beginning
of Christianity, it ought to have been there, for, as our holy
religion comes from God, it should contain in itself all the means
possible to elevate the nations to the highest point of liberty and
happiness.”<a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II">II.</a><br />

THE ANTE-NICENE CHURCH.</h2>


<p>Although no thought existed in the mind of Paul, and of his co-laborers
in founding the church of the Gentiles, of prohibiting to his
disciples the institution of marriage, there was a distinct flavor of
asceticism in some of his teachings, which might readily serve as a
warrant to those whose zeal was greater than their discretion, to
mortify the flesh in this as in other ways. The Apostle, while
admitting that the Lord had forbidden the separation of husband and
wife, said of the unmarried and widowers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they cannot contain let
them marry, for it is better to marry than to burn.”</p></blockquote>

<p>And though in one passage he seems to indicate a belief that
woman could only be saved by maternity from the punishment incurred
by the disobedience of Eve, in another he formally declares that “he
that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in
marriage doeth better,” thus showing a marked preference for the
celibate state, in which the devout could give themselves up wholly
to the service of the Lord.<a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>The Apostle’s discussion of these subjects shows that already there
had commenced a strong ascetic movement, raising questions which
he found hard to answer, without on the one hand repressing the
ardor of serviceable disciples, and on the other, imposing burdens on
neophytes too grievous to be borne. He foresaw that the former
would soon run beyond the bounds of reason, and he condemned in
advance the heresies which should forbid marriage;<a id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> but that the
tendency of the faithful lay in that direction was inevitable. In
those times, no one would join the infant church who did not regard
the things of earth as vile in comparison with the priceless treasures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
of heaven, and the more fervent the conviction, the more it was apt
to find expression in mortifying the flesh and purchasing salvation by
the sacrifice of passions and affections. Such especially would be
the tendency of the stronger natures which lead their fellows; and
the admiration of the multitude for their superior virtue and fortitude
would soon invest them with a reputation for holiness which would
render them doubly influential.</p>

<p>There was much, indeed, in the teaching of the church, and in its
relations with the Gentiles, to promote and strengthen this tendency.
The world into which Christianity was born was hopelessly corrupt.
Licentiousness, probably, has never been more defiant than amid the
splendors of the early Empire. The gossip of Suetonius and the
denunciations of Juvenal depict a society in which purity was scarce
understood, and in which unchastity was no sin and hardly even a
reproach. To reclaim such a population needed a new system of
morality, and it is observable that in the New Testament particular
stress is laid upon the avoidance of fornication, especially after the
faith had begun to spread beyond the boundaries of Judea. The
early Christians thus were a thoroughly puritan sect, teaching by example
as well as by precept, and their lives were a perpetual protest
against the license which reigned around them.<a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> It therefore was
natural that converts, after their eyes were opened to the hideous
nature of the prevailing vices, should feel a tendency to plunge into
the other extreme, and should come to regard even the lawful indulgence
of human instincts as a weakness to be repressed. Civilization,
indeed, owes too much to the reform which Christianity rendered
possible in the relations of the sexes, for us to condemn too severely
even the extravagances into which it was sometimes betrayed.</p>

<p>That it was becoming not uncommon for Christians to follow a
celibate life is shown by various passages in the early fathers. St.
Ignatius alludes to abstinence from marriage in honor of God as a
matter not uncommon, but which was wholly voluntary and to be
practised in humility and secrecy, for the virtue of continence would
be much more than counterbalanced by the sin of pride.<a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
Apologists, Justin Martyr about the year 150, Athenagoras about 180,
and Minucius Felix about 200, all refer to the chastity and sobriety
which characterized the sect, the celibacy practised by some members,
and the single marriage of others, of which the sole object was the
securing of offspring and not the gratification of the passions. Athenagoras,
indeed, condemns the exaggerations of asceticism in terms
which show that already they had made their appearance among the
more ardent disciples, but that they were strongly disapproved by the
wiser portion of the Church. Origen seems to regard celibacy as
rather springing from a desire to serve God without the interruptions
arising from the cares of marriage than from asceticism, and does not
hesitate to condemn those who abandoned their wives even from the
highest motives.<a id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> The impulse towards asceticism, however, was too
strong to be resisted. Zealots were not wanting who boldly declared
that to follow the precepts of the Creator was incompatible with
salvation, as though a beneficent God should create a species which
could only preserve its temporal existence by forfeiting its promised
eternity. Ambitious men were to be found who sought notoriety or
power by the reputation to be gained from self-denying austerities,
which brought to them followers and believers venerating them as
prophets. Philosophers were there, also, who, wearied with the endless
speculations of Pythagorean and Platonic mysticism, sought
relief in the practical morality of the Gospel, and perverted the simplicity
of its teachings by interweaving with it the subtle philosophy
of the schools, producing an apparent intoxication which plunged
them either into the grossest sensuality or the most rigorous asceticism.
Such were Julian Cassianus, Saturnilus, Marcion, the founder of the
Marcionites, Tatianus, the heresiarch of the Encratitians, and the
unknown authors of a crowd of sects which, under the names of
Abstinentes, Apotactici, Excalceati, etc., practised various forms of
self-mortification, and denounced marriage as a deadly sin.<a id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> Such,
on the other hand, were Valentinus and Prodicus who originated the
mystic libertinism of the Gnostics; Marcus, whose followers, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
Marcosians, were accused of advocating the most disgusting practices,
Carpocrates who held that the soul was obliged to have experience of
all manner of evil before it could be elevated to God; Basilides whose
sectaries honored the passions as emanating from the Creator, and
taught that their impulses were to be followed. Even the Ebionites
did not escape the taint, if Epiphanius is to be believed; and there
was also a sect advocating promiscuous intercourse, to whom the name
of Nicolites was given in memory of the story of Nicholas, the
deacon of the primitive church, who offered to his fellow-disciples the
wife whom he was accused of loving with too exclusive a devotion—a
sect which merited the reproof of St. John, and which has a special
interest for us because in the eleventh century all who opposed clerical
celibacy were branded with its name, thus affording to the sacerdotal
party the inestimable advantage of stigmatizing their antagonists
with an opprobrious epithet of the most damaging character, and of
invoking the authority of the Apocalypse for their destruction.<a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>The church was too pure to be led astray by the libertinism of
the latter class of heresiarchs. The time had not yet come for the
former, and men who, in the thirteenth century, might perhaps have
founded powerful orders, and have been reverenced by the Christian
world as new incarnations of Christ, were, through their anachronism,
stigmatized as heretics, and expelled from the communion of
the faithful. Still, their religious fervor and rigorous virtue had a
gradually increasing influence in stimulating the development of the
ascetic principle, if not in the acknowledged dogmas, at all events,
in the practice of the church, as may be seen when, towards the close
of the second century, Dionysius of Corinth finds himself obliged
to reprove Pinytus, Bishop of Gnosus, for endeavoring to render
celibacy compulsory among his flock, to the manifest danger of those
whose virtue was less austere.<a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> In all this, unquestionably, the
ascetic ideas of the East had much to do, and these were chiefly represented
by Buddhism, which, since the reign of Asoka, in the third
century B.C., had been the dominant religion of India. A curious
allusion in St. Jerome to Buddha’s having been born of a virgin,<a id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
shows a familiarity with details of Buddhist belief which presupposes
a general knowledge of that faith; and though the divinized Maya,
wife of Suddhodana, is not absolutely described as a virgin in eastern
tradition, yet she and her husband had taken a vow of continence
before Buddha, from the Tushita heaven, to fulfil his predestined
salvation of mankind and establishment of the kingdom of righteousness,
had selected her as the vehicle of his incarnation. Much in
the legend of his birth, of the miracles which attended it, of his
encounter with the Tempter, and other details of his life, is curiously
suggestive of the source whence sprang the corresponding legend of
the life of Christ, more particularly as related in the pseudo-gospels.<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>
Not only this, but many of the observances of Latin Christianity
can scarce be explained save by derivation from Buddhism, such as
monasticism, the tonsure, the use of rosaries, confession, penance,
and absolution, the sign of the cross, relic-worship, and miracles
wrought by relics, the purchase of salvation by gifts to the church,
pilgrimages to sacred places, etc. etc. Even the nimbus which in sacred
art surrounds the head of holy personages, is to be found in the
sculptures of the Buddhist Topes, and the Sangreal, or Holy Cup of
the Last Supper, which was the object of lifelong quest by the
Christian knight, is but the Patra or begging-dish of Buddha, which
was the subject of many curious legends.<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> It is no wonder that
when the good Jesuit missionaries of the sixteenth century found
among the heathen of Asia so much of what they were familiar with
at home, they could not decide whether it was the remains of a preëxisting
Catholicism, or whether Satan, to damn irrevocably the souls
of men, had parodied and travestied the sacred mysteries and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
ceremonies, and introduced them in those distant regions.<a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> We are therefore
safe in ascribing to Buddhist beliefs at least a portion of the
influence which led the church into the extravagances of asceticism.</p>

<p>The first official manifestation of this growing tendency, applied to
the relations of the sexes, is to be seen in the legislation with regard
to second marriages. In the passages alluded to above from Athenagoras
and Minucius Felix, the fact is referred to that second marriages were
already regarded as little better than adulterous, while Justin Martyr
denounces them as sinful, in spite of the permission so freely granted
by St. Paul for such unions.<a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> Though this opinion was branded by
the church as heretical when it was elevated into an article of belief
by the Montanists and Cathari, or Puritans, and though even the
eminence and piety of Tertullian could not save him from excommunication
when he embraced the doctrine, yet the orthodox came very
near accepting it, for the Council of Neocæsarea, in 314, forbade
priests from honoring with their presence the festivities customary
on such occasions, as those who married a second time were subject
to penance, and that of Laodicea, in 352, deemed it a matter of
indulgence to admit to communion those who contracted such unions,
after they had redeemed their fault by fasting and prayer for a
certain time—a principle repeated by innumerable councils during
the succeeding centuries. So far did this prejudice extend that as
late as 484 we find the Pope, St. Gelasius, obliged to remind the
faithful that such marriages are not to be refused to laymen.<a id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> It is
by no means impossible that this opposition to repeated wedlock
may have arisen, or perhaps have been intensified, by a similar feeling
which existed among the Pagans, at least with regard to the
second marriages of women. Moreover, in Rome the Flamen Dialis
was restricted to a single marriage with a virgin, and such was the
strictness with which this was observed that as the assistance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
Flaminica, his wife, was necessary to the performance of some religious
rites, he was obliged to resign when left a widower.<a id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>Although the church forbore to prohibit absolutely the repetition
of matrimony among the laity, it yet, at an early though uncertain
period, imitated the rule enforced on the Flamen Dialis, and rendered
it obligatory on the priesthood, thus for the first time drawing a distinct
line of separation between the great body of the faithful and
those who officiated as ministers of Christ. It thus became firmly
and irrevocably established that no “digamus” or husband of a
second wife was admissible to holy orders. As early as the time of
Tertullian we find the rule formally expressed by him, and he even
assures us that the whole structure of the church was based upon the
single marriages of its ministers. Indeed, the holy rites came to
be regarded as so entirely incompatible with repetition of wedlock
that the Council of Elvira, in 305, while admitting that in cases of
extreme necessity a layman might administer baptism, is careful to
specify that he must not be a “digamus.”<a id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>Yet this restriction on the priesthood was not easily enforced, and
already we begin to hear the complaints, which have followed uninterruptedly
for more than fifteen hundred years, of the evasion or disregard
of the regulations whereby the church has sought to repress
the irrepressible instincts of humanity. In the early part of the
third century Hippolytus, Bishop of Portus, in his enumeration of
the evil ways of Pope Calixtus, taxes the pontiff with admitting to
the priesthood men who had been married twice, and even thrice,
and with permitting priests to marry while in orders. Even the
great apostle of celibacy, St. Jerome, expresses surprise that Oceanus
should object to Carterius, a Spanish bishop, on the ground that he
had had a wife before baptism, and a second one after admission to
the church. The world, he adds, is full of such prelates, not only in
the lower orders but in the episcopate, the digamous members of which
exceed in number the three hundred prelates lately assembled at the
Council of Rimini. Yet this was the formal rule of the church as
enunciated in the Apostolic Constitutions and Canons—bodies of ecclesiastical
law not included, indeed, in the canon of Scripture, but yet so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
venerable that their origin was already lost sight of, and they were everywhere
received as authoritative expositions of primitive discipline.<a id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>The introduction of this entering-wedge is easily explicable. St.
Paul had specified the monogamic condition—“unius uxoris vir”—as
a prerequisite to the diaconate, priesthood, and episcopate, and the
temper of the times was such as to lead irresistibly to this being
taken in its literal sense, rather than to adopt the more rational view
that it was intended to exclude those among the Gentiles who indulged
in the prevalent vice of concubinage, or who among the Jews
had fallen into the sin of polygamy—or those among either race who
had taken advantage, either before or after conversion, of the disgraceful
laxity prevalent with regard to divorces, for, as we learn
from Origen, the rule was by no means obeyed which forbade a
divorced person to marry during the lifetime of the other spouse.<a id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>When once this principle was fairly established, and when at the
same time the efforts of the Montanists to render it binding on the
whole body of Christian believers had failed, a distinction was enforced
between the clergy and the laity, as regards the marriage-tie,
which gave to the former an affectation of sanctity, and which was
readily capable of indefinite expansion. It is therefore easy to comprehend
the revival, which shortly followed, of the old Levitical rule
requiring the priesthood to marry none but virgins—a rule which
was early adopted, though it took long to establish it in practice, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
as late as 414 we find Innocent I. complaining that men who had
taken widows to wife were even elevated to the episcopate, and Leo
I. devoted several of his epistles to its enforcement.<a id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> A corollary to
this speedily followed, which required a priest whose wife was guilty
of adultery to put her away, since further commerce with her rendered
him unfit for the functions of his office; and this again, as
subsequent authorities were careful to point out, afforded a powerful
reason for requiring absolute celibacy on the part of the clergy, for,
in view of the fragility of the sex, no man could feel assured that he
was not subject to this disability, nor could the faithful be certain
that his ministrations were not tainted with irregularity.<a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> We thus
reach the state of ecclesiastical discipline at the close of the third
century, as authoritatively set forth in the Apostolical Constitutions
and Canons—bishops and priests allowed to retain the wives which
they may have had before ordination, but not to marry in orders;
the lower grades, deacons, subdeacons, etc., allowed to marry after
entering the church; but all were to be husbands of but one wife,
who must be neither a widow, a divorced woman, nor a concubine.<a id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, public opinion had moved faster than the canons.
Ascetic sects multiplied and increased, and the highest authorities in
the church could not always resist the contagion. A fresh incitement,
indeed, had been found in the neo-platonic philosophy which
arose in the beginning of the third century. Ammonius Saccas, its
founder, was a Christian, though not altogether orthodox, and his
two most noted disciples, Origen and Plotinus, fairly illustrate the
influence which his doctrines had upon both the Christian and the
Pagan world. As to the latter, neo-platonism borrowed from Christian
and Indian as well as Greek philosophy, evolving out of them
all a system of elevated mysticism in which the senses and the appetites
were to be controlled as severely almost as in the Sankhya
and Buddhist schools. Commerce between the sexes was denounced
as a pollution degrading to the soul, and the best offering which a
worshipper could bring to the Deity was a soul absolutely free from
all trace of passion.<a id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> Although neo-platonism engaged in a hopeless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
struggle to stay the advancing tide of Christianity, and thus became
its most active opponent, yet the lofty asceticism which it inculcated
could not be without influence upon its antagonists, were it only
through inflaming the emulation of those who were already predisposed
to regard the mortification of the flesh as a means of raising
the soul to communion with God.<a id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>How these motives worked upon an ardent and uncompromising
temperament is seen in the self-sacrifice of Origen, showing how absorbing
was the struggle, and how intense was the conviction that
nature must be conquered at all hazards and by any practicable
means, although he himself afterwards condemned this practical rendering
of the text (<i>Matt. xix. 12</i>) on which it was founded. Origen
was by no means the first who had sought in this way to gain the
kingdom of heaven, for he alludes to it as a matter by no means unexampled,
and before him Justin Martyr had chronicled with approbation
a similar case. In fact, there is said to have been an obscene
sect which under the name of Valesians followed the practice and
procured proselytes by inflicting forcible mutilation upon all who
were unhappy enough to fall into their hands; and though their
date and locality are unknown to those who allude to them, it would
be rash, in view of similar eccentricities existing in more modern
times, to pronounce them wholly apocryphal. The repeated prohibitions
of the practice, in the canons of the succeeding century,
show how difficult it was to eradicate the belief that such self-immolation
was an acceptable offering to a beneficent Creator. Sextus
Philosophus, an ascetic author of the third century, whose writings
long passed current under the name of Pope Sixtus II., did not hesitate
openly to advocate it, and though his arguments were regarded
as heretical by the church, they were at least as logical as the practical
application given to the texts commonly cited in defence of the
prohibition of marriage.<a id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>Not all, however, who sought the praise or the merits of austerity
were prepared to pay such a price for victory in the struggle with
themselves. Enthusiastic spirits, exalted with the prospect of earthly
peace and heavenly rewards promised to those who should preserve
the purity of virginity and live abstracted from the cares and pleasures
of family life, frequently took the vow of continence which had
already become customary. This vow as yet was purely voluntary.
It bound those who assumed it only during their own pleasure, nor
were they during its continuance, in any way segregated from the
world. So untrammelled, indeed, were their actions that Cyprian is
forced to rebuke the holy virgins for frequenting the public baths in
which both sexes indiscriminately exposed themselves, and he does
not hesitate to attribute to this cause much of the ruin and dishonor
of its votaries which afflicted the church.<a id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> Yet, this was by no means
the severest trial to which many of them subjected their constancy.
Perhaps it was to court spiritual martyrdom and to show to their admirers
a virtue robust enough to endure the most fiery trials, perhaps
it was that they found too late that they had overestimated their
strength, and that existence was a burden without the society of some
beloved object—but, whatever may have been the motive, it became
a frequent custom to associate themselves with congenial souls of the
other sex, and form Platonic unions in which they aspired to maintain
the purity which they had vowed to God. At the best, the sensible
members of the church were scandalized by these performances,
which afforded so much scope for the mockery of the heathen; but
scandal frequently was justified, for Nature often asserted her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
outraged rights to the shame and confusion of the hapless votaries of an
artificial and superhuman perfection. Tertullian does not hesitate to
assert that the desire of enjoying the reputation of virginity led to
much secret immorality, the effects of which were concealed by resort
to infanticide.<a id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> Cyprian chronicles, not with surprise but sorrow,
the numerous instances which he had known of ruin resulting
to those who had so fatally miscalculated their power of resistance:
with honest indignation he denounces the ecclesiastics who abandoned
themselves to practices which, if not absolutely criminal, were brutally
degrading: and with a degree of common-sense hardly to be
looked for in so warm an admirer of the perfection of virginity, he
advises that those whose weakness rendered doubtful the strict observance
of their vows should return to the world and satisfy their
longings in legitimate marriage.<a id="FNanchor_55_55" href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> The heresiarch Paul of Samosata
affords, perhaps, the most conspicuous example of the extent to which
these and similar practices were sometimes carried, and in condemning
him, the good fathers of the Council of Antioch lamented the general
prevalence of the evils thence arising.<a id="FNanchor_56_56" href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Cyprian’s prudent consideration
for the weakness of human nature was as yet shared by the
ecclesiastical authorities. In the order of widows professed, which
was recognized by the early church, the Apostolic Constitutions enjoin
that none should be admitted below the age of sixty, in order to avoid
the danger of their infringing their vows by a second marriage, but
the writer is careful to add that such a marriage is not to be condemned
for itself, but only on account of the falsehood which it occasioned.
These widows and virgins were supported out of the tithes
of the church, and were, therefore, necessarily subjected to its control,
so that it is perfectly evident that there was nothing irrevocable
in the vows wherewith they were bound. The change is marked by
the end of the century, when widows who thus forsook their order
were unrelentingly and irrevocably condemned, deprived of communion,
and expelled from social intercourse.<a id="FNanchor_57_57" href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>While the Christian world was thus agitated with the speculative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
doctrines and practical observances of so many enthusiasts, heretical
and orthodox, who seemed to regard the relations between the sexes
as the crucial test and most trustworthy exponent of religious ardor,
a new dogma arose in the East and advanced with a rapidity which
shows how much progress the ascetic spirit had already made, and
how ripe were the unsettled minds of zealots to welcome whatever
system of belief promised to trample most ruthlessly upon nature,
and to render the path of salvation inaccessible to all save those
capable of the sternest self-mortification. Towards the end of the
third century, the Persian Manes made his advent in the Empire,
proclaiming himself as the Paraclete and as a new and higher Apostle.
Though his career as an envoy of Christ was stoutly resisted by the
orthodox, and though, after a chequered life, he was flayed alive, and
his followers in Persia were slaughtered by Varahran I.,<a id="FNanchor_58_58" href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> his western
disciples were more fortunate, and the hateful name of Manichæan
acquired a sinister notoriety which maintained its significance for a
thousand years. His system was a compound of several faiths, and
though it failed in its comprehensive design to bring all mankind
together in one form of belief, it yet had features which won for it
the enthusiastic adhesion of men of diverse races. The way was
already prepared for its reception among both Gentiles and Christians
by the prevalence on the one hand of the Mithraic worship,
and on the other of Gnosticism. The Dualistic theory was attractive
to those who were disheartened in the vain attempt to reconcile the
existence of evil with an omnipotent and all-merciful Creator; the
Platonic identity of the soul with the Godhead was a recommendation
to the schoolmen; the Brahmanical and Buddhist views as to
abstinence from meat and marriage won adherents among the remains
of the ascetic sects, and were acceptable even to those among the
orthodox who were yielding to the increasing influence of asceticism.
The fierce temporal persecution of the still Pagan emperors, and the
unavailing anathemas of the church, as yet confined to mere spiritual
censures, seemed only to give fresh impetus to the proselyting energy
of the Elect, and to scatter the seed more widely among the faithful.
After this period we hear but little of the earlier ascetic heresies;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
the system of Manes, as moulded by his followers, was so much
more complete, that it swallowed up its prototypes and rivals, and
concentrated upon itself the vindictiveness of a combined church and
state. So thorough was this identification that in 381 an edict of
Theodosius the Great directed against the Manichæans assumes that
the sects of Encratitæ, Apotactitæ, Hydroparastitæ, and Saccofori
were merely nominal disguises adopted to elude detection.<a id="FNanchor_59_59" href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>That Manichæism, in fact, exercised a substantial influence over
orthodoxy is shown in other directions besides that of asceticism.
It can scarce be doubted that the expansion of the penitential remission
of sins into the system of purchasable indulgences received a
powerful impulsion from the precedent set by Manes; and the denunciations
of Ephraem Syrus form a fitting precursor to those of
Luther. In the same way the Eucharist was diverted from its original
form of a substantial meal—one of the means by which the
charity of the church was administered to the poor—into the symbolical
wafer and wine which assimilated it so closely to the Izeshne
sacrifice, the most frequent Mazdean rite, and one which, like the
Mass, was customarily performed for the benefit of departed souls.<a id="FNanchor_60_60" href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>
Manes, in combining Mazdeism with Christianity, had adopted the
Eucharist in the Mazdean form, and had confined the use of the cup
to the priesthood; and this lay communion in one element became
so well recognized as a test of Manichæism that Leo the Great
ordered the excommunication of all who received the sacrament after
that fashion.<a id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> It may therefore be remarked as a curious coincidence
that when Manichæism was revived by the Albigenses, in the eleventh
and twelfth centuries, the church, which until then had preserved its
ancient custom, adopted the lay communion in one element and
adhered to it so rigidly that, as we shall see hereafter, not even
the dread of the Hussite schism nor the earnest requests of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
who remained faithful during the perils of the Reformation, could
induce it to grant the cup to the laity. Lay communion in one element
drew a line of distinction between the priest and his flock
which the former would not willingly abandon.</p>

<p>Although, in the region of asceticism, the church might not be
willing to adopt the Manichæan doctrine that man’s body is the work
of the Evil Principle, and that the Soul as partaking of the substance
of God was engaged in an eternal war with it, and should thus
abuse and mortify it<a id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>, yet the general tendencies of the religious enthusiasm
of the time made the practical result common to all, and
there can be no doubt that the spreading belief in Manes exercised a
powerful influence in accelerating the progress of orthodox asceticism.
The fact that as yet the church was persecuted and had no
power of imposing its yoke on others bound it to the necessity of
maintaining its character for superior sanctity and virtue; and ardent
believers could not afford to let themselves be outdone by heretics in
the austerities which were popularly received as the conclusive evidence
of religious sincerity. We may therefore easily imagine a
rivalry in asceticism which, however unconscious, may yet have powerfully
stimulated the stern and unbending souls of such men as St.
Antony, Malchus, and Hilarion, even as Tertullian, after combating
the errors of Montanus, adopted and exaggerated his ascetic heresies.
It would be easy to show from the hagiologies how soon the church
virtually assented to the Manichæan notion that the body was to be
mortified and macerated as the only mode of triumphing in the perennial
struggle with the evil principle, but this would be foreign to
our subject. It is sufficient for us here to indicate how narrowly in
process of time she escaped from adopting practically, if not theoretically,
the Manichæan condemnation of marriage. This is clearly
demonstrated by the writings of the orthodox Fathers, who in their
extravagant praise of virginity could not escape from decrying wedlock.
It was stigmatized as the means of transmitting and perpetuating
original sin, an act which necessarily entailed sin on its
participants, and one which at best could only look for mercy and
pardon and be allowed only on sufferance. It is therefore not surprising
if those who were not prepared to join in the progress of
asceticism should habitually stigmatize the mortifications of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
more enthusiastic brethren as Manichæism in spirit if not in name.
Jovinian, it would seem, did not neglect this ready means of attack;
nor was he alone, for Jerome complains that the worldly and dissolute
sheltered themselves behind the same excuse, and derided as
Manichæans all who were pallid and faint from maceration and fasting.<a id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>
The comparison, indeed, became a not untruthful one, when
the Christian and the heretic both adopted the plan of restricting their
sacred class from the pleasures of the world—when the Manichæan
Elect, who remained unmarried and fasted upon vegetable food, were
equivalent to the priesthood, while the Auditors, to whom a larger
liberty was allowed, represented the orthodox laity. It is by no
means improbable that the tenets of the Manichæans have been exaggerated
by their opponents in controversy, and that in process of
time, when the church became avowedly ascetic, there was practically
little difference on this point between Manichæism and Orthodoxy.
St. Augustin, indeed, represents the Manichæan Faustus as arguing
that both in doctrine and practice his sect only followed the example
of the church. He ridicules the idea that it could prohibit marriage,
and asserts positively that it only encouraged those who manifested
a desire to persevere in continence. If this is to be received as an
authentic exposition of Manichæan principles, it will be seen that
the church was not long in outstripping the heretics.<a id="FNanchor_64_64" href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>In fact, even as early as the time of Cyprian, that saint, in allusion
to the parable of the sower, had rated the comparative merits of martyrdom
to virginity as one hundred to sixty; while, after martyrdom
had gone out of fashion, St. Patrick, in the fifth century, undertook
a more elaborate classification in which bishops and doctors of the
church, monks and virgins, were rated at one hundred, ecclesiastics
in general and widows professed at sixty, while the faithful laity
stand only at thirty.<a id="FNanchor_65_65" href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> It was therefore a heresy for Jovinian to
claim equal merit for maidens, wives, and widows; and though St.
Jerome, in controverting this, commenced by carefully denying any
intentional disrespect towards marriage, still his controversial ardor
carried him so far in that direction, that he aroused considerable
feeling among reasonable men and was obliged formally and repeatedly
to excuse himself. His contempt for marriage, indeed, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
so extreme that in spite of the recognized primacy of St. Peter, he
considered that apostle as decidedly inferior to St. John, because the
one had a wife and the other was a virgin—apparently not observing
that, as he denied the marriage of all the apostles save Peter, he was
thus relegating the head of the church to the last place among the
holy twelve.<a id="FNanchor_66_66" href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> St. Augustin recognized the difficulty of reconciling
the current views of his time with the necessities of humanity when
he wrote a treatise for the purpose of proving the difference between
the good of marriage and the evil of carnal desire, which, while it
perpetuated the species, likewise perpetuated original sin; and he
gave a signal example of the manner in which enthusiastic asceticism
sought to improve upon the work of the Creator when he uttered the
pious wish that all mankind should abstain from marriage, so that
the human race might the sooner come to an end.<a id="FNanchor_67_67" href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> St. Martin of
Tours was somewhat less extravagant when he was willing to admit
that marriage was pardonable, while licentiousness was punishable
and virginity glorious; and he was far behind the enthusiasts of his
time, for, while he deplores the miserable folly of those who consider
marriage to be equal to virginity, he is likewise obliged to reprove
the error of those who were willing only to compare it to lechery—the
former belief being evidently much more erroneous than the
latter in the Saint’s estimation.<a id="FNanchor_68_68" href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> So a treatise on chastity, which
passes under the name of Sixtus III., barely admits that married
people can earn eternal life; and it apparently is only the dread of
being classed with Manichæans that leads the author to shrink from
the conclusions of his own reasoning, and to state that he does not
absolutely condemn wedlock or prohibit it to those who cannot restrain
their passions.<a id="FNanchor_69_69" href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> Not a little Manichæan in its tendency is a
declaration of Gregory the Great to Augustin the Apostle of England
that connubial pleasures cannot possibly be free from sin; and
quite as decided is another assertion of the same Pope that the strictness
of monastic life is the only possible mode of salvation for the
greater portion of mankind.<a id="FNanchor_70_70" href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> It was the natural practical deduction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
from this which is drawn by the Penitential of Theodore, when it
commands those who contract a first marriage to abstain from entering
a church for thirty days, after which they are to perform penance
for forty more; while a digamus is subjected to penance for a year,
and a trigamus, or one oftener married, for seven years.<a id="FNanchor_71_71" href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> When
marriage was thus regarded as a sin, we can scarcely be surprised at
the practical Manichæism of Epiphanius who declares that the church
is based upon virginity as on its corner-stone.<a id="FNanchor_72_72" href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>This ascetic development, however, was not destined to triumph
without occasional efforts at repression. At the close of the third
century, the highest authorities of the church still condemned the
ruthless asceticism, which was subsequently glorified as the loftiest
achievement of Christian virtue. Thus in the Apostolic Constitutions,
the influence of Manichæism and its kindred sects is as yet
only manifested by the opposition aroused to their doctrines; and the
necessity of that opposition is indicated by the careful and repeated
declaration of the purity and sanctity of the marriage-tie, both as
regards the priesthood and the laity. Not less instructive is the bare
toleration almost grudgingly extended to vows of celibacy, and the
cautious restriction which declares that such vows are not to be held
as justifying a disparagement of matrimony.<a id="FNanchor_73_73" href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> No stronger contrast
can be looked for than that produced by little more than a century
between the rational piety of these provisions and the extravagant
rhapsodies of Jerome, Augustin, and Martin. The calm good sense
of Lactantius also takes occasion to reprove the extravagance which
regarded all indulgence of the natural affections as a sin requiring
repentance and pardon. He assumes indeed that perpetual continence,
as being opposed to the law of nature, is not recommended,
but only permitted by the Creator, thus reversing the maxims of the
zealots.<a id="FNanchor_74_74" href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> Equally suggestive are the Apostolic Canons. The sixth
of these pronounces deposition on the bishop or priest who separates
himself from his wife under pretext of religion; while the fiftieth
threatens equally rigorous punishment on the clerk or layman who
shall abstain from marriage, from wine, or from meat, not for the
purpose of devoting himself to piety, but on account of holding them
in abomination—such belief being a slander on the goodness of God,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
and a calumny on the perfection of His works.<a id="FNanchor_75_75" href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> Even a hundred
years later there is still an occasional protest to be heard, showing
how the more moderate section of the church still felt the danger to
which she was exposed by intemperate ascetic zeal, and how narrow
was the path which she had to trace between orthodoxy and heresy.
The Fourth Council of Carthage, in 398, prescribing the examination
to which all bishops-elect were to be subjected, specifies for
inquiry among other points of faith questions as to whether the candidate
disapproves of marriage, or condemns second marriages, or
prohibits the use of meat.<a id="FNanchor_76_76" href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> It shows how readily Manichæism or
Catharism might lurk in the asceticism of the most devout.</p>

<p>The tide, however, was fairly on the flood, and the resistance of the
more reasonable among ecclesiastics was unavailing. It is true, that the
influences which were now so powerful could evidently not be applied
to the whole body of believers, as they would only result in gradual
extinction or in lawless licentiousness; but as the ecclesiastical body
was perpetuated by a kind of spiritual generation, it could, without
hazarding a decrease of numbers, be subjected to regulations which
should render obligatory the asceticism which as yet had been optional.
The only wonder, in fact, is that this had not been earlier attempted.
Such a rule, by widening the distinction between laymen and ecclesiastics,
would be grateful to the growing sacerdotalism which ere long
was to take complete possession of the church. Such a rule, moreover,
was not only indicated by the examples of Buddhism and Manichæism,
but had abundant precedent among the Pagans of the Empire. More
than one passage in classical writers show that abstinence from women
was regarded as an essential prerequisite to certain religious observances,
and the existence of this feeling among the primitive Christians,
based upon the injunction of Ahimelech, is indicated by St. Paul<a id="FNanchor_77_77" href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>—and
this custom, as sacerdotalism developed, and formalism rendered
the life of the minister of the altar a ceaseless round of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
daily service, would practically separate husband and wife. Moreover,
much of the Pagan worship subjected its officials to general
restrictions of greater or less severity. Diodorus Siculus states that
the Egyptian priests were permitted to have but one wife, although
unlimited polygamy was allowed to the people; while Chæremon the
Stoic, according to St. Jerome, and Plutarch indicate that they were
obliged to observe entire continence. The castration of the Galli,
the priests of Rhea at Hierapolis, though explained by the myth of
Attys, was evidently only a survival of the fierce asceticism which
counterbalanced the licentiousness of the older Phenician worship.
The rites of the Gaditanian Hercules were conducted by ministers
obliged to observe chastity, and the foot of woman was not permitted
to pollute the sacred precincts of the temple; while the priestesses of
Gea Eurysternus at Ægæ were required to preserve the strictest
celibacy.<a id="FNanchor_78_78" href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> The hierophants of Demeter in Athens, were obliged to
maintain unsullied continence. The priestesses of the Delphic
Apollo, the Achaian Hera, the Scythian Artemis, and the Thespian
Heracles were virgins. In Africa, those of Ceres were separated from
their husbands with a rigor of asceticism which forbade even a kiss
to their orphaned children; while in Rome the name of Vestal has
passed into a proverb, although it is true that while they were only
six or seven in number, the distinguished honors and privileges accorded
to them were insufficient to induce parents to devote them to
the holy service, and there was difficulty in keeping the ranks filled.<a id="FNanchor_79_79" href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>The earliest recorded attempt by the church to imitate these restrictions,
was made in 305 by the Spanish council of Elvira, which
declared, in the most positive manner, that all concerned in the
ministry of the altar should maintain entire abstinence from their
wives under pain of forfeiting their positions. It further endeavored
to put an end to the scandals of the Agapetæ, or female companions
of the clergy, which the rigor of this canon was so well fitted to
increase, by decreeing that no ecclesiastic should permit any woman
to dwell with him, except a sister or a daughter, and even these only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
when bound by a vow of virginity.<a id="FNanchor_80_80" href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> This was simply the legislation
of a local synod, and its canons were not entitled to respect or obedience
beyond the limits of the churches directly represented. Its
action may not improbably be attributed to the commanding influence
of one of its leading members, Osius, Bishop of Cordova, and that
action had no result in inducing the church at large to adopt the new
rule, for some ten years later were held the more important councils
of Ancyra and Neocæsarea, and the absence of any allusion to it in
their proceedings seems to fix for us the discipline of the period in
this respect, at least in the East. By the canons of Ancyra we
learn that marriage in orders was still permitted, as far as the
diaconate, provided the postulant at the time of ordination declared
his desire to enjoy the privilege and asserted his inability to remain
single. This is even less stringent than the rule quoted above from
the Apostolic Constitutions, and proves incontestably that there was
no thought of imposing any restriction upon the intercourse between
the married clergy and their wives. By the council of Neocæsarea
it was provided that a priest marrying in orders should be deposed,
but a heavier punishment was reserved for what was then, in reverse
of the standard of later times, regarded as the greater sin of licentiousness.
That no interference was intended by this with the relations
existing between those who had married in the lower grades
and their wives, is shown by another canon which deprives of his
functions any priest who submitted to the commission of adultery by
his wife without separating from her—being a practical extension of
the Levitical rule, now by common consent adopted as a portion of
ecclesiastical discipline.<a id="FNanchor_81_81" href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> Yet, even in the East, there was a growing
tendency to more rigid asceticism than this, for, about the same
period, we find Eusebius stating that it is becoming in those who are
engaged in the ministry of God, to abstain from their wives, though
his argument in justification of this is based upon the multiplicity of
occupation, which in civilized society rendered it desirable for those
enlisted in the service of the church to be relieved from family cares
and anxieties.<a id="FNanchor_82_82" href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III">III.</a><br />

THE COUNCIL OF NICÆA.</h2>


<p>Thus far the church had grown and strengthened without any
recognized head or acknowledged legislative power. Each patriarch
or metropolitan, surrounded by his provincial synod, established regulations
for his own region, with no standard but the canon of Scripture,
being responsible only to the opinion of his compeers, who
might refuse to receive his clergy to communion. Under this democratic
autonomy the church had outlived persecution, had repudiated
and cast out innumerable successive heresies, and, thanks to external
pressure, had managed to preserve its unity. The time, however,
had now come for a different order of things. Constantine, following
the dictates of his unerring political sagacity, allied himself with the
Christians and professed conversion; and Christianity, powerful even
when merely existing on sufferance, became the religion of the state.
As such, the maintenance of its unity was a political necessity, to
accomplish which required some central power entitled to general
respect and implicit obedience. The subtle disputations concerning
the fast-spreading Arian heresy were not likely to be stilled by the
mere <i>ipse dixit</i> of any of the Apostolic Sees, nor by the secular wisdom
of crown lawyers and philosophic courtiers. A legislative tribunal,
which should be at once a court of last appeal and a senate
empowered to enact laws of binding force, as the final decisions of
the Church Universal, was not an unpromising suggestion. Such
an assemblage had hitherto been impossible, for the distances to be
traversed and the expenses of the journey would have precluded an
attendance sufficiently numerous to earn the title of Œcumenic; but
an imperial rescript which put the governmental machinery of posts
at the service of the prelates could smooth all difficulties, and enable
every diocese to send its representative. In the year 325, therefore,
the <span class="smcap">First General Council</span> assembled at Nicæa. With the fruit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>lessness
of its endeavors to extinguish the Arian controversy we have
nothing to do, but in its legislative capacity its labors had an influence
upon our subject which merits a closer examination than would appear
necessary from the seemingly unimportant nature of the proceedings
themselves.</p>

<p>With the full belief that the canons of a general council were the
direct operation of the Holy Ghost, they were of course entitled to
unquestioning reverence, and those of Nicæa have always been regarded
as of special and peculiar authority, cutting off all debate on
any question to which they might be applicable. The third of the
series has been the main reliance of sacerdotal controversialists, and
has been constantly appealed to as the unanswerable justification for
enforcing the rule of discipline which enjoined celibacy on all admitted
to holy orders. Its simple phraseology would hardly seem to
warrant such conclusion. “The Great Synod has strictly forbidden
to bishop, priest, and deacon, and to every ecclesiastic, to have a
‘subintroductam mulierem,’ unless perhaps a mother, a sister, an
aunt, or such person only as may be above suspicion.”<a id="FNanchor_83_83" href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>This is the only allusion to the subject in the Nicene canons. As
it does not include wives among those exempted from the prohibition
of residence, we can hardly be surprised that those who believe
celibacy to be of apostolic origin should assume that it was intended
to pronounce an absolute separation between husband and wife. As
the Council of Elvira, however, contains the only enunciation of such
a rule previous to that of Nicæa, and as those of Ancyra and Neocæsarea
and the Apostolic Constitutions and Canons, directly or indirectly,
allow the conjugal relations of ecclesiastics to remain undisturbed,
we are certainly justified in assuming the impossibility that
an innovation of so much importance would be introduced in the discipline
of the universal church without being specifically designated
and commanded in terms which would admit of no misunderstanding.
That the meaning of the canon is really and simply that alone which
appears on the surface—to put an end to the disorders and scandals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
arising from the improper female companions of unmarried priests—is,
moreover, I think, susceptible of easy demonstration.</p>

<p>The term “subintroducta mulier”—γυνη συνεισακτος—is almost invariably
used in an unfavorable sense, and is equivalent to the
“fœmina extranea,” and nearly to the “focaria” and “concubina”
of later times, as well as to the “agapeta” and “dilecta” of earlier
date. We have already seen how Cyprian, seventy-five years before,
denounced the agapetæ who even then were so common, and whose
companionship proved so disastrous to all parties, but the custom continued,
and its evil consequences became more and more openly and
shamelessly displayed. In 314 the council of Ancyra denounced it
in terms implying its public recognition.<a id="FNanchor_84_84" href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> At the close of the same
century, Jerome still finds in it ample material for his fiery indignation;
and his denunciations manifest that it was still a corroding
cancer in the purity of the church, prevailing to an extent that rendered
its suppression a matter of the utmost importance.<a id="FNanchor_85_85" href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> The testimony
of Epiphanius is almost equally strong, and shows that it was
a source of general popular reproach.<a id="FNanchor_86_86" href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> Such a reform was therefore
well worthy the attention of the Nicene fathers, and that this was
the special object of the canon is indicated by Jerome himself, who
appeals to it as the authority under which an ecclesiastic refusing to
separate himself from his agapeta could be punished; it was to be
read to the offender, and if he neglected obedience to its commands,
he was to be anathematized.<a id="FNanchor_87_87" href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>That it had no bearing upon the wives of priests can moreover
be proved by several reasons. The restriction on matrimony has
never at any time extended below the subdiaconate, the inferior
grades of the secular clergy having always been free to live with
their wives, even in the periods of the most rigid asceticism. The
canon, however, makes no distinction. Its commands are applicable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
“alicui omnino qui in clero est.” To suppose, therefore, that it
was intended to include wives in its restriction is to prove too much—the
<i>reductio ad absurdum</i> is complete.<a id="FNanchor_88_88" href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> Equally convincing is
the fact that when, towards the close of the century, the rule of celibacy
and separation was introduced, and Siricius and Innocent I.
ransacked the Gospels for texts of more than doubtful application
with which to support the innovation, they made no reference whatever
to the Nicene canon.<a id="FNanchor_89_89" href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> Had it been understood at that period
as bearing on the subject, it would have been all-sufficient in itself.
The reverence felt for the Council of Nicæa was too great, and the
absolute obedience claimed for its commands was too willingly rendered,
for such an omission to be possible. That Siricius and Innocent
should not have adduced it is therefore proof incontrovertible
that it was as yet construed as directed solely against the improper
companions of the clergy. If further evidence to the same effect
be required, it may be found in a law of Honorius, promulgated in
420, in which, while forbidding the clergy to keep “mulieres extraneæ”
under the name of “sorores,” and permitting only mothers,
daughters, and sisters, he adds that the desire for chastity does not
prohibit the residence of wives whose merits have assisted in rendering
their husbands worthy of the priesthood.<a id="FNanchor_90_90" href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> The object of the
law is evidently to give practical force and effect to the Nicene canon,
and the imperial power under Honorius had sunk to too low an ebb
for us to imagine the possibility of his venturing to tamper with and
overrule the decrees of the most venerable council.<a id="FNanchor_91_91" href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> Even in the
sixth century the Nicene canon was not yet considered to have the
meaning subsequently attributed to it, for otherwise there would have
been no necessity of inserting a provision prohibiting the marriage of
priests in the account forged at that time of a Roman council said to
have been held by Silvester I.<a id="FNanchor_92_92" href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p>If the proof thus adduced be as convincing as it appears to me,
the story of Paphnutius is not so important as to deserve the amount
of controversy that has been expended upon it, and a brief reference
is all that seems necessary. Socrates and Sozomen relate that while
the canons of the council were under consideration, some of the
fathers desired to introduce one interdicting all intercourse between
those in orders and their wives. Whereupon Paphnutius, an Egyptian
bishop, protested against the heavy burden to be thus imposed
upon the clergy, quoting the well-known declaration of St. Paul to
the Hebrews respecting the purity of the marriage-bed. The influence
of St. Paphnutius was great, for he was a confessor of peculiar
sanctity; the loss of his right eye bore testimony to the severity
of the persecutions which he had endured, and his immaculate
chastity, preserved from boyhood in a monastery, rendered his motives
and his impartiality on the subject unimpeachable. The bishops,
who had been on the point of accepting the proposed canon, were
convinced, and the project was abandoned.<a id="FNanchor_93_93" href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>If this account be true, it of course follows that the third canon
has no bearing on the wives of ecclesiastics, and that the enforcement
of celibacy dates from a later period than that of the council. Accordingly,
when the Nicene canon was found necessary to give
authority to the rule, it became requisite to discredit the story of
Paphnutius. The first attempt to do this, which has come under
my observation, occurred during the fierce contentions aroused by
the efforts of Gregory VII. to restore the almost forgotten law of
celibacy. Bernald of Constance has left a record of a discussion
held by him in 1076 with Alboin, a zealous defender of sacerdotal
marriage, in which the authenticity of the story is hotly contested.<a id="FNanchor_94_94" href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>
Bernald’s logic may be condensed into the declaration that he considered
it much more credible that Sozomen was in error than that so holy
a man as St. Paphnutius could have been guilty of such blasphemy.
No reason whatever was vouchsafed when Gregory VII. caused the
story to be condemned in the Synod of Rome of 1079.<a id="FNanchor_95_95" href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> In spite
of this, Pius IV., in 1564, admitted its authenticity in his epistle to
the German princes who had requested of him the concession of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
sacerdotal marriage.<a id="FNanchor_96_96" href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> Later writers, from Bellarmine down, have,
however, entered into elaborate arguments to prove its impossibility.
They rest their case principally on the assertion of the existence of
celibacy as a rule anterior to the council, and on its enforcement
afterwards; on the fact that Socrates and Sozomen flourished a little
more than a century after the council, and that they are therefore
untrustworthy; and that the name of St. Paphnutius does not appear
in the acts of the council. To the first of these objections the
preceding pages afford, I think, a sufficient answer; to the second it
can only be replied that we must be content with the best testimony
attainable, and that there is none better than that of the two historians,
whose general truthfulness and candor are acknowledged;<a id="FNanchor_97_97" href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>
and to the third it may be remarked that of the 318 bishops present,
but 222 affixed their signatures to the acts, while Rufinus and Theodoret
both expressly assert that Paphnutius was present.<a id="FNanchor_98_98" href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> That the
statement was not discredited until controversialists found it desirable
to do so, is shown by its retention in the full account of the proceedings
of the council by Gelasius of Cyzicus, in the fifth century,
and also by its repetition in the “Historia Tripartita,” a condensation
of the narratives of Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret, compiled
in the sixth century by Cassiodorus, whose irreproachable orthodoxy
would hardly have permitted him to give it currency if it had then
been considered as blasphemous as the writers of the eleventh century
would have us believe. In fact, the learned and orthodox Christian
Wolff, in his great work on the Councils, rejects as trifling the assertion
that the story of Paphnutius is fictitious. His theory of the
whole matter is that the western church endeavored to subject the
eastern to its views on the celibacy required of the priesthood; that
the effort failed, in consequence of the opposition of Paphnutius, and
that the canon adopted had reference merely to the scandals of the
Agapetæ.<a id="FNanchor_99_99" href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>Various indications have been collected by controversialists to
show that for some time after the council of Nicæa no interference
was attempted with married priests. Of these, one or two will suffice.</p>

<p>St. Athanasius, whose orthodoxy it would not be prudent for any
one to question, and whose appearance during his diaconate at the
council of Nicæa first attracted general attention to his commanding
abilities, has left us convincing testimony as to the perfect freedom
allowed during his time to all classes of ecclesiastics. An Egyptian
monk named Dracontius had been elected to an episcopate, and hesitated
to accept the dignity lest its duties should prove incompatible
with the fulfilment of his vows. To remove these scruples, Athanasius
addressed him an epistle containing various arguments, among
which was the declaration that in his new sphere of action he would
find no difficulty in carrying out whatever rules he might prescribe
for himself. “Many bishops,” said the Saint, “have not contracted
matrimony, while on the other hand, monks have become fathers.
Again, we see bishops who have children, and monks who take no
thought of having posterity.”<a id="FNanchor_100_100" href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> The tenor of the whole passage is
such as to show that no laws had yet been enacted to control individual
action in such matters, and while rigid asceticism was largely
practised, it was to be admired as the result of private conviction,
and not as mere enforced submission to an established rule.</p>

<p>Testimony equally unequivocal is afforded by the case of St.
Gregory Theologos, Bishop of Nazianzum. He relates that his
father, who was likewise a St. Gregory Bishop of Nazianzum, was
converted about the period of the Nicene council, and was shortly
afterwards admitted to the priesthood and created bishop. His
mother, St. Nonna, prayed earnestly for male issue, saw her future
son St. Gregory in a prophetic vision, and devoted him, before his
birth, to the service of God. That this occurred after his father’s
admission to orders is shown by the address which he represents the
latter as making to him, “I have passed more years in offering the
sacrifice than measure your whole life,”<a id="FNanchor_101_101" href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> while the birth of a younger
son, Cæsarius, shows that conjugal relations continued undisturbed.
St. Gregory evidently felt that neither shame nor irregularity attached
to his birth during the sacred ministry of his father.</p>

LEGISLATION.</h2>


<p>Thus far the progress of asceticism had been the result of moral
influence alone. Those who saw in the various forms of abstinence
and mortification the only path to salvation, and those who may have
felt that worldly advantages of power or reputation would compensate
them for the self-inflicted restrictions which they underwent, already
formed a numerous body in the church, but as yet had not acquired
the numerical ascendency requisite to enable them to impose upon
their brethren the rules which they had adopted for their own
guidance. The period was one of transition, and for sixty years
after the council of Nicæa there was doubtless a struggle for supremacy
not perhaps the less severe because at this late date we can
but dimly trace its outlines amid the records of the fierce Arian controversy
which constitutes the ecclesiastical history of the time, and
which absorbed the attention of writers almost to the exclusion of
everything else.</p>

<p>The first triumph of the ascetic party was in establishing recognized
restrictions on those who had voluntarily assumed vows of
celibacy. With them, at least, the case was clear. Aspiring to no
rank in the church, they simply dedicated themselves to God, and
pledged themselves to lives of abstinence. Their backsliding caused
scandal to the church, which, if it were held responsible in the eyes
of men for their conduct, must necessarily assume the power to control
their mode of life, while the fact of simply holding them to the
performance of vows solemnly undertaken could not reasonably be
regarded as an arbitrary stretch of authority. These voluntary vows,
which speedily led to the establishment of the vast fabric of monachism
will form the subject of a subsequent section, and need not be
further alluded to here.</p>

<p>Another move in the direction of asceticism was the prohibition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
by the Council of Laodicea in 352 of women serving as priests or
presiding over the churches.<a id="FNanchor_102_102" href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> Although in later Judaism the Temple
service was confined to men, the examples of Deborah and Huldah
show that in earlier times women were considered as capable of
inspiration and were sometimes revered as prophets; the Gentiles,
among whom the infant churches were founded, had priestesses almost
everywhere actively employed in the duties of worship and sacrifice;
and it would have been strange if women, to whom the propagation
of the Gospel was so greatly owing, had not been sometimes admitted
to the function of conducting the simple services of the primitive
church. We learn from St. Paul that Phœbe was a deacon (διάκονος)
of the church at Cenchrea,<a id="FNanchor_103_103" href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> and the canon of Laodicea shows that
until the middle of the fourth century they still occasionally occupied
recognized positions in the active ministry of the church. They
could not have been numerous, or the references to them in the
history of the period would have been more frequent, and the enforcement
of their disability for divine service would have required constant
repetition in the canons of the general and local synods; but
unquestionably the growth of Mariolatry and the adoration of female
saints would have sufficed to prevent the inconsistency of regarding
women as absolutely unfitted for any function in public worship, had
it not been for the rising influence of asceticism, which demanded
the separation of the sexes, and insisted upon an artificial purity in
all concerned in the ministry of the altar. Even as late as the tenth
century, so good a celibatarian as Atto of Vercelli was perfectly willing
to assert that in the early church, when the laborers were few,
women were admitted to share in the ceremonies of divine worship.<a id="FNanchor_104_104" href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<p>Still, as yet, the secular clergy were at liberty to follow the dictates
of their own consciences, and if an attempt was made to erect the
necessity of ascetic abstinence into an article of either faith or disci<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>pline,
the church was prompt to stamp it with the seal of unequivocal
reprobation. Eustathius, Bishop of Sebastia, in Cappadocia, himself
the son of the Bishop of Cappadocian Cæsarea, Eulalius, carried his
zeal for purity to so great an excess that his exaggerated notions of
the inferiority of the married state trenched closely upon Manichæism,
although his heretical rejection of canonical fasting showed that on
other points he was bitterly opposed to the tenets of that obnoxious
sect. His horror of matrimony went so far as to lead him to the
dogma that married people were incapable of salvation; he forbade
the offering of prayer in houses occupied by them; and he declared
that the blessings and sacraments of priests living with their wives
were to be rejected, and their persons treated with contempt.<a id="FNanchor_105_105" href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>There were not wanting those to whom even these extreme opinions
were acceptable, and Eustathius speedily accumulated around him a
host of devotees whose proselyting zeal threatened a stubborn heresy.
The excesses attributed to their inability to endure the practical operation
of their leader’s doctrines may be true, or may be merely the
accusations which are customarily disseminated when it becomes
necessary to invest schismatics with odium. Be this as it may, the
orthodox clergy felt the importance of promptly repressing opinions
which, although at variance with the creed of the church, were yet
dangerously akin to the extreme views of those who were regarded as
pre-eminently holy. Eulalius, the father of the heresiarch, himself
presided at a local synod held at Cæsarea, and condemned his son.
This did not suffice to repress the heresy, and about the year 362 a
provincial council was assembled at Gangra, where fifteen bishops,
among whom was Eulalius, pronounced their verdict on Eustathius
and his misguided followers, and drew up a series of canons defining
the orthodox belief on the questions involved. That they were received
by the church as authoritative is evident from their being included
in the collections of Dionysius and Isidor. These canons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
anathematize all who refuse the sacraments of a married priest, and
who hold that he cannot officiate on account of his marriage; also
those who, priding themselves on their professed virginity, arrogantly
despise their married brethren, and who hold that the duties of wedlock
are incompatible with salvation.<a id="FNanchor_106_106" href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> The whole affords a singularly
distinct record of the doctrines accepted at this period, showing that
there was no authority admitted for imposing restrictions of any kind
on the married clergy. It probably was an effort on the part of the
conservatives of the church to restrain their more progressive brethren,
and they no doubt gladly availed themselves of the wild theories of
Eustathius to stigmatize the extravagances which were daily becoming
more influential. At the same time, they were careful to shield themselves
behind a qualified concession to the ascetic spirit of the period,
for in an epilogue they apologetically declare their humble admiration
of virginity, and their belief that pious continence is most acceptable
to God.<a id="FNanchor_107_107" href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In little more than twenty years after this emphatic denunciation
of all interference with married priests, we find the first absolute command
addressed to the higher orders of the clergy to preserve inviolate
celibacy. So abrupt a contrast provokes an inquiry into its possible
causes, as no records have reached us exhibiting any special reasons
for the change.</p>

<p>While the admirers of ascetic virginity became louder and more
enthusiastic in their praises of that blessed condition, it is fair to
presume that they were daily more sensible of a lower standard of
morality in the ministers of the altar, and that their susceptibilities
were more deeply shocked by the introduction and growth of abuses.
While the church was kept purified by the fires of persecution, it
offered few attractions for the worldly and ambitious. Its ministry
was too dangerous to be sought except by the pure and zealous
Christian, and there was little danger that pastors would err except
from over-tenderness of conscience or unthinking ardor. When, however,
its temporal position was incalculably improved by its domina<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>tion
throughout the empire, it became the avenue through which
ambition might attain its ends, while its wealth held out prospects of
idle self-indulgence to the slothful and the sensual. A new class of
men, dangerous alike from their talents or their vices, would thus
naturally find their way into the fold, and corruption, masked under
the semblance of austerest virtue, or displayed with careless cynicism,
would not be long in penetrating into the Holy of Holies. Immorality
must have been flagrant when, in 370, the temporal power felt
the necessity of interfering by a law of the Emperor Valentinian
which denounced severe punishment on ecclesiastics who visited the
houses of widows and virgins.<a id="FNanchor_108_108" href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> When an increasing laxity of morals
thus threatened to overcome the purity of the church, it is not surprising
that the advocates of asceticism should have triumphed over
the more moderate and conservative party, and that they should improve
their victory by seeking a remedy for existing evils in such
laws as should render the strictest continence imperative on all who
entered into holy orders. They might reasonably argue that if
nothing else were gained, the change would at least render the life
of the priest less attractive to the vicious and the sensual, and that
the rigid enforcement of the new rules would elevate the character of
the church by preventing such wolves from seeking a place among
the sheep. If by such legislation they only added fresh fuel to the
flame; if they heightened immorality by hypocrisy and drove into
vagabond licentiousness those who would perhaps have been content
with lawful marriage, they only committed an error which has ever been
too common with earnest men of one idea to warrant special surprise.</p>

<p>Another object may not improbably have entered into the motives
of those who introduced the rule. The church was daily receiving
vast accessions of property from the pious zeal of its wealthy
members, the death-bed repentance of despairing sinners, and the
munificence of emperors and prefects, while the effort to procure
the inalienability of its possessions dates from an early period.<a id="FNanchor_109_109" href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> Its
acquisitions, both real and personal, were of course exposed to much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
greater risk of dilapidation when the ecclesiastics in charge of its
widely scattered riches had families for whose provision a natural
parental anxiety might be expected to override the sense of duty in
discharging the trust confided to them. The simplest mode of averting
the danger might therefore seem to be to relieve the churchman
of the cares of paternity, and, by cutting asunder all the ties of family
and kindred, to bind him completely and forever to the church and
to that alone. This motive, as we shall see, was openly acknowledged
as a powerful one, in later times, and it no doubt served as an argument
of weight in the minds of those who urged and secured the
adoption of the canon.</p>

<p>It appears to me not unreasonable to suppose that all these various
motives lent additional force to the zeal for the purity of the church,
and to the undoubting belief in the necessity of perpetual celibacy,
which impelled the popes, about the year 385, to issue the first definite
command imposing it as an absolute rule of discipline on the
ministers of the altar. The question evidently was one which largely
occupied the minds of men, and the conclusion was reached progressively.
A Roman synod, to which the date of 384 is assigned, answered
a series of interrogatories propounded by the bishops of Gaul,
among which was one relating to the chastity of the priesthood. To
this the response was rather argumentatory and advisory in its character
than imperative; the continence of the higher grades of ecclesiastics
was insisted on, but no definite punishment was ordered for
its violation<a id="FNanchor_110_110" href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>—and no maxim in legislation is better understood than
that a law without a penalty expressed is practically a dead letter.
Allusion was made to previous efforts to enforce the observance in
various churches; surprise was expressed that light should be sought
for on such a question—for the Gallic prelates had evidently been in
doubt respecting it—and numerous reasons were alleged in a manner
to show that the subject was as yet open to argument, and could not
be assumed as proved or be decided by authority alone. These reasons
may be briefly summed up as consisting of references to the well-known
texts referred to in a previous section, together with a vague
assertion of the opinion of the Fathers to the same effect. Allusion
was made to the inconsistency of exhortations to virginity proceeding
from those who themselves were involved in family cares and duties,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
a reasonable view when we consider how much of ecclesiastical machinery
by this time turned on monachism; and the necessity was
urged of bishops, priests, and deacons preserving the purity requisite
to fit them for the daily sacrifice of the altar and the ministration of
the sacraments. This latter point was based upon the assumption of a
similar abstinence being imposed by the old law on the Levites during
their term of service in the Temple, and the example of the pagan
priesthood was indignantly adduced to shame those who could entertain
a sacrilegious doubt upon a matter so self-evident.<a id="FNanchor_111_111" href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> The conclusion
arrived at was definite, but, as I have already remarked, no
means were suggested or commanded for its enforcement.</p>

<p>Not many months later Pope Damasus died, but the cause was
safe in the hands of his successor. Scarcely had Siricius ascended
the pontifical throne, when, in 385, he addressed an epistle to
Himerius, Archbishop of Tarragona, expressing his grief and indignation
that the Spanish clergy should pay so little regard to the
sanctity of their calling as to maintain relations with their wives.
It is evident from the tenor of the decretal that Himerius had been
unable to enforce the new discipline, and had appealed to Rome for
assistance in breaking down the stubborn resistance which he had
encountered, for allusion is made to some of the refractory who had
justified themselves by the freedom of marriage allowed to the Levites
under the old law, while others had expressed their regret and had
declared their sin to be the result of ignorance. Siricius adopted a
much firmer tone than his predecessor. He indulged in less elaboration
of argument; a few texts, more or less apposite; an expression
of wonder that the rule should be called in question; a distinct assertion
of its application to the three grades of bishops, priests, and
deacons; a sentence of expulsion on all who dared to offer resistance,
and a promise of pardon for those who had offended through igno<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>rance,
allowing them to retain their positions as long as they observed
complete separation from their wives, though even then they
were pronounced incapable of all promotion—such was the first definitive
canon, prescribing and enforcing sacerdotal celibacy, exhibited
by the records of the church.<a id="FNanchor_112_112" href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>The confident manner in which the law is thus laid down as incontrovertible
and absolute might almost make us doubt whether it were
not older than the preceding pages have shown it to be, if Siricius
had not confessed the weakness of the cause by adopting a very
different tone within a year. In 386 he addressed the church of
Africa, sending it certain canons adopted by a Roman synod. Of
these the first eight relate to observances about which there was at
that time no question, and they are expressed in the curtest and most
decisive phraseology. The ninth canon is conceived in a spirit totally
different. It persuades, exhorts, and entreats that the three orders
shall preserve their purity; it argues as to the propriety and necessity
of the matter, which it supports by various texts, but it does not
assume that the observance thus enjoined is even a custom, much less
a law, of the church; it urges that the scandal of marriage be removed
from the clergy, but it threatens no penalty for refusal.<a id="FNanchor_113_113" href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>
Siricius was too imperious and too earnest in all that he undertook
for us to imagine that he would have adopted pleading and entreaty
if he had felt that he possessed the right to command; nor would he
have condescended to beg for the removal of an opprobrium if he
were speaking with all the authority of unquestioned tradition to
enforce a canon which had become an unalterable part of ecclesiastical
discipline.</p>

<p>It is observable that in these decretals no authority is quoted later
than the Apostolic texts, which, as we have seen, have but little
bearing on the subject. No canons of councils, no epistles of earlier
popes, no injunctions of the Fathers are brought forward to strengthen
the position assumed, whence the presumption is irresistible that
none such existed, and we may rest satisfied that no evidence has
been lost that would prove the pre-existence of the rule.</p>

ENFORCEMENT OF CELIBACY.</h2>


<p>Celibacy was but one of the many shapes in which the rapidly
progressing sacerdotalism of Rome was overlaying religion with a
multitude of formal observances. That which in earlier times had
been the spontaneous expression of fervid zeal, or the joyful self-sacrifice
of ardent asceticism, was thus changed into a law, bearing
upon all alike, and taking no count of the individual idiosyncrasies
which might render the burden too heavy for the shoulders of the
less fiery though not less conscientious Christian. That it should
meet with resistance was to be expected when we consider that the
local independence of primitive times had not as yet been crushed
under the rapidly growing preponderance of the Roman see. In
fact energetic protests were not wanting, as well as the more perplexing
stubbornness of passive resistance.</p>

<p>St. Ambrose admits that although the necessity of celibacy was
generally acknowledged, still, in many of the remoter districts, there
were to be found those who neglected it, and who justified themselves
by ancient custom, relying on precautions to purify themselves for
their sacred ministry.<a id="FNanchor_114_114" href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> In this he gives countenance to the tradition
of the Leonistæ, simple Christians whose refusal to adapt themselves
to the sacerdotalism, which was daily becoming more rigorous and
indispensable, caused their expulsion from Rome, and who, taking
refuge in the recesses of the Cottian Alps, endeavored to preserve
the unadulterated faith of earlier times in the seclusion and privation
of exile.</p>

<p>All who revolted against the increasing oppression of the hierarchy
were not, however, content to bury themselves in solitude and silence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
and heresiarchs sprang up who waged a bold but unequal contest.
Bonosus, Jovinian, and Vigilantius are the names which have reached
us as the most conspicuous leaders in the unsuccessful attempt to
turn back the advancing spirit of the age, and of these Jovinian is
the foremost figure. Bonosus, who was Bishop of Sardica, acquired
a peculiarly sinister notoriety, for, in his opposition to the ascetic
spirit, he adopted a heresy of Tertullian and Photinus, and assailed
one of the chief arguments of the admirers of celibacy by denying
the perpetual virginity of the Virgin; whence his followers acquired
the euphonious title of Bonosiacs.<a id="FNanchor_115_115" href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> For this he was denounced by
Pope Siricius with all the vehemence which doctrines so sacrilegious
were calculated to excite,<a id="FNanchor_116_116" href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> and his followers were duly condemned by
the Council of Capua in 389, while the tireless pen of St. Jerome
was called into requisition to refute errors so unpardonable.<a id="FNanchor_117_117" href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> Notwithstanding
this they continued to flourish, for an epistle of Innocent
I. to Lawrence, Bishop of Segna, proves that the error was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
openly taught on the eastern shores of the Adriatic in the early part
of the fifth century;<a id="FNanchor_118_118" href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> in 443 the Council of Arles shows their existence
in France by promising reconciliation to those who should
manifest proper repentance, and that of Orleans as late as 538 still
contains an allusion to them.<a id="FNanchor_119_119" href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> The belief even extended to Arabia,
where a sect professing it is stigmatized by Epiphanius as Antidicomarianitarians,
whose conversion that worthy bishop endeavored to
secure by a long epistle, in which his labored explanations of the
stubborn text of Matthew are hardly more convincing than his
hearty objurgations of the blasphemous dogma, or his illustrative
comparison of the Virgin to a lioness bearing but one whelp.<a id="FNanchor_120_120" href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While Jovinian shared in this particular the error of Bonosus and
Helvidius, he did not attach undue importance to it. More practically
inclined, his heresy consisted principally in denying the efficacy
of celibacy, and this he maintained in Rome itself, with more zeal
than discretion. Siricius caused his condemnation and that of his
associates in a synod held about the year 390,<a id="FNanchor_121_121" href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> and succeeded in
driving him to Milan, where he had many proselytes. There was no
peace for him there. A synod held under the auspices of St. Ambrose
bears testimony to the wickedness of his doctrines and to the
popular clamor raised against him, and the wanderer again set forth
on his weary pilgrimage.<a id="FNanchor_122_122" href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> Deprived of refuge in the cities, he disseminated
his tenets throughout the country, where ardent followers,
in spite of contumely and persecution, gathered around him and conducted
their worship in the fields and hamlets. The laws promulgated
about this time against heresy were severe and searching, and
bore directly upon all who deviated from the orthodox formulas of
the Catholic church, yet Jovinian braved them all. The outraged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
church called upon its most unscrupulous polemic, St. Jerome, who
indulged in the customary abuse which represented the schismatics
as indulging in the grossest promiscuous licentiousness and Jovinian
as teaching them that all things were permitted to those baptized in
Christ, in contradiction to St. Augustin who admits the sobriety
and virtue of Jovinian, in spite of his denying the efficacy of celibacy.<a id="FNanchor_123_123" href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>
All this was insufficient to put down the stubborn schismatics,
who maintained their faith until the church, wearied out with their
obstinacy and unable to convert or to silence them, appealed to the
secular power for more efficient assistance. Perhaps Jovinian’s long
career of successful resistance may have emboldened him; perhaps
his sect was growing numerous enough to promise protection; at all
events, despite the imperial rescripts which shielded with peculiar
care the Apostolic city from the presence of heretics, Jovinian in
412 openly held assemblages of his followers in Rome, to the scandal
of the faithful, and made at least sufficient impression to lead a
number of professed virgins to abandon their vows and marry.<a id="FNanchor_124_124" href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> The
complaints of the orthodox were heard by the miserable shadow who
then occupied the throne of Augustus, and Honorius applied himself
to the task of persecution with relentless zeal. Jovinian was scourged
with a leaded thong and exiled to the rock of Boa, on the coast of
Dalmatia, while his followers were hunted down, deported, and
scattered among the savage islands of the Adriatic.<a id="FNanchor_125_125" href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nor was this the only struggle. A wild shepherd lad named
Vigilantius, born among the Pyrenean valleys, was fortunate enough
to be the slave of St. Sulpicius Severus, whose wealth, culture,
talents, and piety rendered him prominent throughout Southern Gaul.
The earnest character of the slave attracted the attention of the
master; education developed his powers; he was manumitted, and
the people of his native Calagurris choose him for their priest. Sent
by Sulpicius as bearer of letters to his friends St. Paulinus at Nola,
and St. Jerome in his Bethlehem retreat, Vigilantius had the opportunity
of comparing the simple Christianity of his native mountains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
with the splendid pageantry of Rome, the elegant retirement of Nola,
and the heated controversialism which agitated the asceticism of
Bethlehem. Notwithstanding the cordiality of their first acquaintance,
his residence with Jerome was short. Both were too earnestly
dogmatic in their natures for harmony to exist between the primitive
Cantabrian shepherd and the fierce apostle of Buddhist and Mazdean
Christianity, who devoted his life to reconciling the doctrines of the
Latin church with the practices of Manichæism. Brief friendship
ended in a quarrel, and Vigilantius extended his experiences by a
survey of Egypt, where the vast hordes of Nitrian anchorites were
involved in civil strife over the question of Origenism. Returning
through Italy, he tarried in Milan and among the Alps, where he
found the solution of his doubts and the realization of his ideas in
the teaching of Jovinian. He had left Gaul a disciple; he returned
to it a missionary, prepared to do battle with sacerdotalism in all its
forms. Not only did he deny the necessity of celibacy, but he pronounced
it to be the fertile source of impurity, and in his zeal for
reform he swept away fasting and maceration, he ridiculed the adoration
of relics, and pronounced the miracles wrought at their altars to be
the work of demons; he objected to the candles and incense around the
shrines, to prayers for the dead, and to the oblations of the faithful.<a id="FNanchor_126_126" href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p>No doubt the decretals of Siricius had rendered compulsory the
celibacy of the priesthood throughout Gaul and Spain. The machinery
of the hierarchy may readily have stifled open opposition,
however frequent may have been the secret infractions of the rule.
This may perhaps have contributed to the success of Vigilantius.
Even his former master, St. Sulpicius Severus, and St. Exuperius,
Bishop of Toulouse, were inclined to favor his reforms. That they
spread with dangerous rapidity throughout Gaul from south to north
is shown by the fact that in 404 Victricius, Bishop of Rouen, and in
405 St. Exuperius of Toulouse applied to Innocent I. for advice as
to the manner in which they should deal with the new heresy. It
also counted numerous adherents throughout Spain, among whom
even some bishops were enumerated. The alarm was promptly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
sounded, and the enginery of the church was brought to bear upon
the hardy heretic. The vast reputation and authority of Jerome
lent force to the coarse invective with which he endeavored to overwhelm
his whilom acquaintance, and though the nickname of Dormitantius
which he bestowed on Vigilantius was a sarcasm neither very
severe nor very refined, the disgusting exaggeration of his adversary’s
tenets in which he as usual indulged had doubtless its destined effect.<a id="FNanchor_127_127" href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>
Pope Innocent was not backward in asserting the authority of Rome
and the inviolable nature of the canon. In his epistle to Victricius,
he repeated the decretal of Siricius, but in a somewhat more positive
form;<a id="FNanchor_128_128" href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> while in the following year (405) he confirmed the vacillating
faith of Exuperius by declaring that any violation of the strictest
celibacy on the part of priest or deacon subjects the offender to the
deprivation of his position.<a id="FNanchor_129_129" href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> As in the previous effort of Siricius,
however, ignorance is admitted as an excuse, entitling him who can
plead it to retain his grade without hope of preferment—and the test
of this ignorance is held to be the canon of 385. This latter point
is noteworthy, for it is a tacit confession of the novelty of the rule,
although Innocent labored at great length to prove both its antiquity
and necessity from the well-known texts of St. Paul and the Levitical
observances. Yet no intermediate authority was quoted, and punishment
was only to be inflicted on those who could be proved to have
seen the decretal of Siricius.</p>

<p>The further career of Vigilantius and his sectaries is lost in the
darkness and confusion attendant upon the ravages of the Alans and
Vandals who overran Gaul during the following year. We only
know that Sulpicius and Exuperius, frightened by the violence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
Jerome and the authority of Innocent, abandoned their protégé, and
we can presume that, during the period of wild disorder which followed
the irruption of the Barbarians, what little protection Rome
could afford was too consoling to the afflicted churches for them to
risk its withdrawal by resisting on any point the daily increasing
pretensions of the Apostolic See to absolute command.<a id="FNanchor_130_130" href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>

<p>The victory was won, for with the death of Vigilantius and Jovinian
ended the last organized and acknowledged attempt to stay the progress
of celibacy in the Latin church, until centuries later, when the
regulation was already too ancient and too well supported by tradition
and precedent to be successfully called in question.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Africa we find no trace of open resistance to the introduction
of the rule, though time was evidently required to procure its enforcement.
We have seen that Siricius, in 386, addressed an appeal to
the African bishops. To this they responded by holding a council
in which they agreed “conscriptione quadam” that chastity should
be preserved by the three higher orders. This apparently was not
conclusive, for in 390 another council was held in which Aurelius,
Bishop of Carthage, again introduced the subject. He recapitulated
their recent action, urged that the teaching of the Apostles and
ancient usage required the observance of the rule, and obtained the
assent of his brother prelates to the separation from their wives of
those who were concerned in administering the sacraments.<a id="FNanchor_131_131" href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> The
form of these proceedings shows that it was an innovation, requiring
deliberation and the assent of the ecclesiastics present, not a simple
affirmation of a traditional and unalterable point of discipline, and,
moreover, no penalty is mentioned for disobedience. Little respect,
probably, was paid to the new rule. The third and fourth councils
of Carthage, held in 397 and 398, passed numerous canons relating
to discipline, prescribing minutely the qualifications and duties of
the clergy, and of the votaries of the monastic profession. The
absence from among these canons of any allusion to enforced celibacy
would therefore appear to prove that it was still left to the conscience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
of the individual. If this be so, the triumph of the sacerdotal party
was not long delayed, as might be expected from the rising influence
and authority of St. Augustin, whose early Manichæism led him,
after his conversion, to be one of the most enthusiastic admirers and
promoters of austere asceticism. We may not unreasonably assume
that it was through his prompting that his friend St. Aurelius, at the
fifth council of Carthage in 401, proposed a canon, which was adopted,
ordering the separation of the married clergy of the higher grades
from their wives, under pain of deprivation of office.<a id="FNanchor_132_132" href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> As before,
the form of the canon shows it to be an innovation.</p>

<p>That the rule was positively adopted and frequently submitted to
is shown by St. Augustin, who, in his treatise against second marriages,
states that, in arguing with those desirous of entering upon
those unhallowed unions, he was accustomed to strengthen his logic
by citing the continence of the clergy, who, however unwillingly
they had in most cases been forced to undertake the burden, still, by
the aid of God, were enabled to endure it to the end.<a id="FNanchor_133_133" href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> Yet it is
evident that its enforcement was attended with many difficulties and
much opposition, for, twenty years later, at another council of Carthage,
we find Faustinus, the Papal Legate, proposing that the three
higher orders shall be separated from their wives, to which the fathers
of the council somewhat evasively replied that those who were con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>cerned
in the ministry of the altar should be chaste in all things.
No attempt, however, was apparently made to strengthen the resolution
by affixing a penalty for its infringement. It was a simple
declaration of opinion, and nothing more.<a id="FNanchor_134_134" href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></p>

<p>Symptoms of similar difficulty in the rigid enforcement of the
canon are observable elsewhere. The proceedings of the first council
of Toledo, held in the year 400, shows not only that it was a recent
innovation which continued to be disregarded, but that it had given
rise to a crowd of novel questions which required imperatively to be
settled, as to the status of the several grades of clerks who were
guilty of various forms of disobedience<a id="FNanchor_135_135" href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a>—the prototype and examplar
of innumerable similar attempts at legislation which continued for
more than a thousand years to occupy a good part of the attention
of almost every council and synod. The prelates of Cis-Alpine
Gaul, assembled in the council of Turin in 401, could only be
brought to pronounce incapable of promotion those who contravened
the injunction which separated them from their wives.<a id="FNanchor_136_136" href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> The practical
working of this was to permit those to retain their wives who
were satisfied with the grade to which they had attained. Thus the
priest, who saw little prospect of elevation to the episcopate, might
readily console himself with the society of his wife, while the powerful
influence of the wives would be brought to bear against the promptings
of ambition on the part of their husbands. The punishment
thus was heaviest on the lower grades and lightest on the higher
clergy, whose position should have rendered the sin more heinous—in
fact, the bishop, to whom further promotion was impossible,
escaped entirely from the penalty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<p>Even as late as 441 the first council of Orange shows how utterly
the rule had been neglected by ordering that for the future no married
man should be ordained deacon without making promise of separation
from his wife, for contravention of which he was to suffer
degradation; while those who had previously been admitted to orders
were only subjected to the canon of the council of Turin, incurring
merely loss of promotion.<a id="FNanchor_137_137" href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> This evidently indicates that the regulation
was a novelty, for it admits the injustice of subjecting to the
rigor of the canon those who had taken orders without being aware
of the obligations incurred; and it is a fair conclusion to suppose
that this was a compromise by which the existing clergy gave their
assent to the rule for the benefit of their successors, provided that
they themselves escaped its full severity. In fact, it seemed to be
impossible to make the church of Gaul accept the rule of discipline.
About 459, we find Leo I., in answer to some interrogatories of
Rusticus, Bishop of Narbonne, laboriously explaining that deacons
and subdeacons, as well as bishops and priests, must treat their wives
as sisters.<a id="FNanchor_138_138" href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> Rusticus had evidently asked the question, and Leo
expresses no surprise at his ignorance.</p>

<p>The Irish Church, founded about the middle of the fifth century,
although it was to a great extent based on monachism, apparently
did not at first order the separation of the sexes. A century later
an effort seems to have been made in this direction; but the canons
of a synod held in the early part of the eighth century show that
priests at that time were not prevented from having wives.<a id="FNanchor_139_139" href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>Even where the authority of the decretals of Siricius and Innocent
was received with respectful silence, it was not always easy to enforce
their provisions. An epistle of Innocent to the bishops of Calabria
shows that, within territory depending strictly upon Rome itself, a
passive resistance was maintained, requiring constant supervision and
interference to render the rule imperative. Some priests, whose
growing families rendered their disregard of discipline as unquestionable
as it was defiant, remained unpunished. Either the bishops
refused to execute the laws, or their sympathies were known to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
with the offenders, for the pious layman whose sensibilities were
wounded by the scandal felt himself obliged to appeal to the Pope.
Innocent accordingly ordered the accused to be tried and to be
expelled, while he expressed no little surprise at the negligence of
the prelates who were so remiss.<a id="FNanchor_140_140" href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> It is more difficult to understand
the edict of 420, issued by Honorius, to which allusion has already
been made (p. 55). This law expressly declares that the desire for
purity does not require the separation of wives whose marriage took
place before the ordination of their husbands.</p>

<p>These disconnected attempts at resistance were unsuccessful. Sacerdotalism
triumphed, and the rule which forbade marriage to those
in orders, and separated husband and wife, when the former was
promoted to the ministry of the altar, became irrevocably incorporated
in the canon law. Throughout the struggle the Papacy had a most
efficient ally in the people. The holiness and the necessity of absolute
purity was so favorite a theme with the leading minds of the
church, and formed so prominent a portion of their daily homilies
and exhortations, that the popular mind could not but be deeply impressed
with its importance, and therefore naturally exacted of the
pastor the sacrifice which cost so little to the flock. An instance or
two occurring about this period will show how vigilant was the watch
kept upon the virtue of ecclesiastics, and how summary was the process
by which indignation was visited upon even the most exalted,
when suspected of a lapse from the rigid virtue required of them.
Thirty years after the ordination of St. Brice, who succeeded St.
Martin in the diocese of Tours, rumor credited him with the paternity
of a child unseasonably born of a nun. In their wrath the citizens
by common consent determined to stone him. The saint calmly
ordered the infant, then in its thirtieth day, to be brought to him,
and adjured it in the name of Christ to declare if it were his, to which
the little one firmly replied “Thou art not my father!” The people,
attributing the miracle to magic, persisted in their resolution, when
St. Brice wrapped a quantity of burning coals in his robe, and
pressing the mass to his bosom carried it to the tomb of St. Martin,
where he deposited his burden, and displayed his robe uninjured.
Even this was insufficient to satisfy the outraged feelings of the populace,
and St. Brice deemed himself fortunate in making his escape
uninjured, when a successor was elected to the bishopric.<a id="FNanchor_141_141" href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> Somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
similar was the case of St. Simplicius, Bishop of Autun. Even as
a layman, his holy zeal had led him to treat as a sister his beautiful
wife, who was inspired with equal piety. On his elevation to the
episcopate, still confident of their mutual self-control, she refused to
be separated from him. The people, scandalized at the impropriety,
and entertaining a settled incredulity as to the superhuman virtue
requisite to such restraint, mobbed the bishop’s dwelling, and expressed
their sentiments in a manner more energetic than respectful.
The saintly virgin called for a portable furnace full of fire, emptied
its contents into her robe, and held it uninjured for an hour, when
she transferred the ordeal to her husband, saying that the trial was
as nothing to the flames through which they had already passed unscathed.
The result with him was the same, and the people retired,
ashamed of their unworthy suspicions.<a id="FNanchor_142_142" href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> Gregory of Tours, who
relates these legends, was sufficiently near in point of time for them
to have an historical value, even when divested of their miraculous
ornaments. They bring before us the popular tendencies and modes
of thought, and show us how powerful an instrument the passions of
the people became, when skilfully aroused and directed by those in
authority.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Western church was thus at length irrevocably committed to
the strict maintenance of ecclesiastical celibacy, and the labors of the
three great Latin Fathers, Jerome, Ambrose, and Augustin, were
crowned with success. It is perhaps worth while to cast a glance at
such evidences as remain to us of the state of morals about this
period and during the fifth century, and to judge whether the new rule
of discipline had resulted in purifying the church of the corruptions
which had so excited the indignation of the anchorite of Bethlehem,
and had nerved him in his fierce contests with those who opposed the
enforced asceticism of the ministers of Christ.</p>

<p>How the morals of the church fared during the struggle is well
exhibited in the writings of St. Jerome himself, as quoted above,
describing the unlawful unions of the agapetæ with ecclesiastics and
the horrors induced by the desire to escape the consequences of incautious
frailty. Conclusions not less convincing may be drawn from
his assertion that holy orders were sometimes assumed on account of
the superior opportunities which clericature gave of improper inter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>course
with women;<a id="FNanchor_143_143" href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> and from his description of the ecclesiastics,
who passed their lives in female companionship, surrounded by young
female slaves, and leading an existence which differed from matrimony
only in the absence of the marriage ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_144_144" href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<p>But a short time after the recognition of the rule appeared the
law of Honorius, promulgated in 420, to which reference has already
been made. It is possible that the permission of residence there
granted to the wives of priests may have been intended to act as a
partial cure to evils caused by the enforcement of celibacy; and this
is rendered the more probable, since other portions of the edict show
that intercourse with improper females had increased to such a degree
that the censures of the church could no longer restrain it, and that
an appeal to secular interference was necessary, by which such practices
should be made a crime to be punished by the civil tribunals.<a id="FNanchor_145_145" href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a>
That even this failed lamentably in purifying the church may be
gathered from the proceedings of the provincial councils of the
period.</p>

<p>Thus, in 453, the council of Anjou repeats the prohibition of
improper female intimacy, giving as a reason the ruin constantly
wrought by it. For those who thereafter persisted in their guilt,
however, the only penalty threatened was incapacity for promotion
on the part of the lower grades, and suspension of functions for the
higher<a id="FNanchor_146_146" href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>—whence we may conclude that practically an option was
afforded to those who preferred sin to ambition. The second council
of Arles, in 443, likewise gives an insight into the subterfuges
adopted to evade the rule and to escape detection.<a id="FNanchor_147_147" href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> About this
period a newly-appointed bishop, Talasius of Angers, applied to
Lupus of Troyes and Euphronius of Autun for advice concerning
various knotty points, among which were the rules respecting the
celibacy of the different grades. In their reply the prelates advised
their brother that it would be well if the increase of priests’ families
could be prevented, but that such a consummation was almost impossible
if married men were admitted to orders, and that if he
wanted to escape ceaseless wrangling and the scandal of seeing chil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>dren
born to his priests, he had better ordain those only who were
single.<a id="FNanchor_148_148" href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> The subject was one of endless effort. In fact, of the
numerous councils whose canons have reached us, held in Gaul and
Spain during the centuries which intervened until the invasion of
the Saracens and the decrepitude of the Merovingian dynasty caused
their discontinuance, there is scarcely one which did not feel the
necessity of legislating on this delicate matter. It would be tedious
and unprofitable to detail specifically the innumerable exhortations,
threats, and ingenious devices resorted to in the desperate hope of
enforcing obedience to the rules and of purifying the morals of the
clergy. Suffice it to say that the constantly varying punishments
enacted, the minute supervision ordered over every action of the
priesthood, the constant attendance of witnesses whose inseparable
companionship should testify to the virtue of each ecclesiastic, and
the perpetual iteration of the rule in every conceivable shape, prove
at once the hopelessness of the attempt, and the incurable nature of
the disorders of which the church was at once the cause and the
victim. In short, this perpetual legislation frequently betrays the
fact that it was not only practically impossible to maintain separation
between the clergy and their wives, but that at times marriage was
not uncommon even within the prohibited orders.<a id="FNanchor_149_149" href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<p>Perhaps this may not move our surprise when we glance at the
condition of morality existing throughout the Empire in the second
quarter of the fifth century, as sketched by a zealous churchman of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
the period. Salvianus, Bishop of Marseilles, was a native of Trèves.
Three times he witnessed the sack of that unfortunate city by the
successive barbarian hordes which swept over Western Europe, and
he lifts up his voice, like Jeremiah, to bewail the sins of his people,
and the unutterable misfortunes which were the punishment but not
the cure of those sins. Nothing can be conceived more utterly
licentious and depraved than the whole framework of society as
described by him, with such details as preclude us from believing
that holy indignation or pious sensibility led him to exaggerate the
outlines or to darken the shades of the picture. The criminal and
frivolous pleasures of a decrepit civilization left no thought for the
absorbing duties of the day or the fearful trials of the morrow.
Unbridled lust and unblushing indecency admitted no sanctity in
the marriage-tie. The rich and powerful established harems, in the
recesses of which their wives lingered, forgotten, neglected, and
despised. The banquet, the theatre, and the circus exhausted what
little strength and energy were left by domestic excesses. The poor
aped the vices of the rich, and hideous depravity reigned supreme
and invited the vengeance of Heaven. Such rare souls as could
remain pure amid the prevailing contamination would naturally take
refuge in the contrast of severe asceticism, and resolutely seek absolute
seclusion from a world whose every touch was pollution. The
secular clergy, however, drawn from the ranks of a society so utterly
corrupt, and enjoying the wealth and station which rendered their
position an object for the ambition of the worldly, could not avoid
sharing to a great extent the guilt of their flocks, whose sins were
more easily imitated than eradicated. Nor does Salvianus confine
his denunciations to Gaul and Spain. Africa and Italy are represented
as even worse, the prevalence of unnatural crimes lending a deeper disgust
to the rivalry in iniquity. Rome was the sewer of the nations,
the centre of abomination of the world, where vice openly assumed its
most repulsive form, and wickedness reigned unchecked and supreme.</p>

<p>It is true that the descriptions of Salvianus are intended to include
the whole body of the people, and that his special references to the
church are but few. Those occasional references, however, are not
of a nature to exempt it from sharing in the full force of his indignation.
When he pronounces the Africans to be utterly licentious,
he excepts those who have been regenerated in religion—but these
he declares to be so few in number that it is difficult to believe them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
Africans. What hope, he asks, can there be for the people when
even in the church itself the most diligent search can scarce discover
one chaste amid so many thousands: and when imperial Carthage
was tottering to its fall under the assaults of the besieging Vandals,
he describes its clergy as wantoning in the circus and the theatre—those
without falling under the sword of the barbarian, those within
abandoning themselves to sensuality.<a id="FNanchor_150_150" href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> This, be it remembered, is
that African church which had just been so carefully nurtured in the
purest asceticism for thirty years, under the unremitting care of
Augustin, who died while his episcopal city of Hippo was encircled
with the leaguer of the Vandals.</p>

<p>Nor were these disorders attributable to the irruption of the Barbarians,
for Salvianus sorrowfully contrasts their purity of morals
with the reckless dissoluteness of the Romans. The respect for
female virtue, inherent in the Teutonic tribes, has no warmer
admirer than he, and he recounts with wonder how the temptations
of luxury and vice, spread before them in the wealthy cities which
they sacked, excited only their disgust, and how, so far from yielding
to the allurements that surrounded them, they sternly set to work to
reform the depravity of their new subjects, and enacted laws to repress
at least the open manifestations which shocked their untutored virtue.</p>

<p>When corruption so ineradicable pervaded every class, we can
scarce wonder that in the story of the trial of Sixtus III., in 440,
for the seduction of a nun, when his accusers were unable to substantiate
the charge, he is said to have addressed the synod assembled
in judgment by repeating to them the story of the woman taken in
adultery, and the decision of Christ. Whether it were intended to
be regarded as a confession, or as a sarcasm on the prelates around
him, whom he thus challenged to cast the first stone, the tale whether
true or false is symptomatic of the time.<a id="FNanchor_151_151" href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>As regards the East, if the accusations brought against Ibas,
Metropolitan of Edessa, at the Synod of Berytus in 448,<a id="FNanchor_152_152" href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> are worthy
of credit, the Oriental church was not behind the West in the
effrontery of sin.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI">VI.</a><br />

THE EASTERN CHURCH.</h2>


<p>During the period which we have been considering, there had
gradually arisen a divergence between the Christians of the East
and of the West. The Arianism of Constantius opposed to the
orthodoxy of Constans lent increased development to the separation
which the division of the Empire had commenced. The rapid
growth of the New Rome founded on the shores of the Bosporus
gave to the East a political metropolis which rendered it independent
of the power of Rome, and the patriarchate there erected absorbed
to itself the supremacy of the old Apostolic Sees, which had previously
divided the ecclesiastical strength of the East. In the West,
the Bishop of Rome was unquestionably the highest dignitary, and
when the separation relieved him of the rivalry of prelates equal in
rank, he was enabled to acquire an authority over the churches of
the Occident undreamed of in previous ages. As yet, however, there
was little pretension of extending that power over the East, and
though the ceaseless quarrels which raged in Antioch, Constantinople,
and Alexandria enabled him frequently to intervene as arbiter,
still he had not yet assumed the tone of a judge without appeal or
of an autocratic lawgiver.</p>

<p>Though five hundred years were still to pass before the Greek
schism formally separated Constantinople from the communion of
Rome, yet already, by the close of the fourth century, the characteristics
which ultimately led to that schism were beginning to
develop themselves with some distinctness. The sacerdotal spirit of
the West showed itself in the formalism which loaded religion with
rules of observance and discipline enforced with Roman severity.
The inquiring and metaphysical tendencies of the East discovered
unnumbered doubtful points of belief, which were argued with exhaustive
subtlety and supported by relentless persecution. However<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
important it might be for any polemic to obtain for his favorite
dogma the assent of the Roman bishop, whose decisions on such
points thus constantly acquired increased authority, yet when the
Pope undertook to issue laws and promulgate rules of discipline,
whatever force they had was restricted to the limits of the Latin
tongue. Accordingly, we find that the decretals of Siricius and
Innocent I. produced no effect throughout the East. Asceticism
continued to flourish there as in its birthplace, but it was voluntary,
and there is no trace of any official attempt to render it universally
imperative. The canon of Nicæa of course was law, and the purity
of the church required its strict observance, to avoid scandals and
immorality;<a id="FNanchor_153_153" href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> but beyond this and the ancient rules excluding digami
and prohibiting marriage in orders no general laws were insisted on,
and each province or patriarchate was allowed to govern itself in
this respect. How little the Eastern prelates thought of introducing
compulsory celibacy is shown by the fact that at the second general
council, held at Constantinople in 381, only four or five years before
the decretals of Siricius, there is no trace of any legislation on the
subject; and this acquires increased significance when we observe
that although this council has always been reckoned Œcumenic, and
has enjoyed full authority throughout the church universal, yet out
of one hundred and fifty bishops who signed the acts, but one—a
Spanish prelate—was from the West.</p>

<p>This avoidance of action was not merely an omission of surplusage.
Had the disposition existed to erect the custom of celibacy into a
law, there was ample cause for legislation on the subject. Epiphanius,
who died in the year 403 at a very advanced age, probably
compiled his “Panarium” not long after this period; he belonged to
the extreme school of ascetics, and lost no opportunity of asserting
the most rigid rule with regard to virginity and continence, which he
considered to be the base and corner-stone of the church. While<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
assuming celibacy to be the rule for all concerned in the functions of
the priesthood, he admits that in many places it was not observed, on
account of the degradation of morals or of the impossibility of obtaining
enough ministers irreprehensible in character to satisfy the needs
of the faithful.<a id="FNanchor_154_154" href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<p>That Epiphanius endeavored to erect into a universal canon rules
only adopted in certain churches is rendered probable by an allusion
of St. Jerome, who, in his controversy with Vigilantius, urged in
support of celibacy the custom of the churches of the East (or
Antioch), of Alexandria, and of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_155_155" href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> He thus omits the great
exarchates of Ephesus, Pontus, and Thrace, as not lending strength
to his argument. Of these the first is perhaps explicable by the
latitudinarianism of its metropolitan, Anthony, Bishop of Ephesus.
At the council of Constantinople, held in 400, this prelate was
accused of many crimes, among which were simony, the conversion
to the use of his family of ecclesiastical property and even of the
sacred vessels, and further, that after having vowed separation from
his wife, he had had children by her.<a id="FNanchor_156_156" href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> Even Egypt, the nursery of
monachism, affords a somewhat suspicious example in the person of
Synesius, Bishop of Ptolemais. This philosophic disciple of Hypatia,
when pressed to accept the bishopric, declined it on various grounds,
among which was his unwillingness to be separated from his wife, or
to live with her secretly like an adulterer, the separation being particularly
objectionable to him, as interfering with his desire for numerous
offspring.<a id="FNanchor_157_157" href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> Synesius, however, was apparently able to reconcile the
incompatibilities, for after accepting the episcopal office, we find, when
the Libyans invaded the Pentapolis and he stood boldly forth to protect
his flock, that two days before an expected encounter, he confided
to his brother’s care his children, to whom he asked the transfer of
that tender fraternal affection which he himself had always enjoyed.<a id="FNanchor_158_158" href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></p>

<p>It is easy to imagine what efforts were doubtless made to extend
the rule and to render it as imperative throughout the East as it was
becoming in the West, when we read the extravagant laudations of
virginity uttered about this time by St. John Chrysostom, who lent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
the sanction of his great name and authority to the assertion that it
is as superior to marriage as heaven is to earth, or as angels are to
men.<a id="FNanchor_159_159" href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> Strenuous as these efforts may have been, however, they have
left no permanent record, and their effect was short-lived. Within
thirty years of the time when Jerome quoted the example of the
eastern churches as an argument against Vigilantius, Socrates chronicles
as a novelty the introduction into Thessalia of compulsory
separation between married priests and their wives, which he says
was commanded by Heliodorus, Bishop of Trica, apparently to compensate
for the amatory character of the “Æthiopica,” written in his
youth. The same rule, Socrates informs us, was observed in Greece,
Macedonia, and Thessalonica, but throughout the rest of the East he
asserts that such separation was purely voluntary, and even that
many bishops had no scruple in maintaining ordinary intercourse
with their wives<a id="FNanchor_160_160" href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a>—a statement easy to be believed in view of the
complaints of St. Isidor of Pelusium, about the same time, that the
rules of the church enjoining chastity received little respect among
the priesthood.<a id="FNanchor_161_161" href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></p>

<p>The influence of Jerome, Chrysostom, and other eminent churchmen,
the example of the West, and the efforts of the Origenians in
favor of philosophic asceticism, doubtless had a powerful effect during
the first years of the fifth century in extending the custom, but they
failed in the endeavor to render it universal and obligatory, and the
testimony of Socrates shows how soon even those provinces which
adopted it in Jerome’s time returned to the previous practice of leaving
the matter to the election of the individual. The East thus preserved
the traditions of earlier times, as recorded in the Apostolic
Constitutions and Canons, prohibiting marriage in orders and the
ordination of digami, but imposing no compulsory separation on those
who had been married previous to ordination.</p>

<p>Even these rules required to be occasionally enunciated in order to
maintain their observance. In 530 a constitution of Justinian calls
attention to the regulation prohibiting the marriage of deacons and
subdeacons, and in view of the little respect paid to it, the Emperor
proceeds to declare the children of such unions spurious (not even
nothi or naturales) and incompetent to inherit anything; the wife is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
likewise incapacitated from inheritance, and the whole estate of the
father is escheated to the church—the severity of which may perhaps
be a fair measure of the extent of the evil which it was intended to
repress.<a id="FNanchor_162_162" href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> Five years later Justinian recurs to the subject, and lays
down the received regulations in all their details. Any one who
keeps a concubine, or who has married a divorced woman or a second
wife, is to be held ineligible to the diaconate or priesthood. Any
member of those orders or of the subdiaconate who takes a wife or a
concubine, whether publicly or secretly, is thereupon to be degraded
and to lose all clerical privileges; and though the strongest preference
is expressed for those who though married preserve strict continence,
the very phrase employed indicates that this was altogether a matter
of choice, and that previous conjugal relations were not subject to
any legislative interference.<a id="FNanchor_163_163" href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> These same regulations were repeated
some ten years later in a law, promulgated about 545,<a id="FNanchor_164_164" href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> which was
preserved throughout the whole period of Greek jurisprudence, being
inserted by Leo the Philosopher in his Basilica,<a id="FNanchor_165_165" href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> quoted by Photius
in the Nomocanon, and referred to as still in force by Balsamon in
the thirteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_166_166" href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> At the same time Justinian tacitly admits
the failure of previous efforts when he adds a provision by which an
unmarried postulant for the diaconate is obliged to pledge himself
not to marry, and any bishop permitting such marriage is threatened
with degradation.<a id="FNanchor_167_167" href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p>Bishops, however, were subjected to the full severity of the Latin
discipline. As early as 528, Justinian ordered that no one should be
eligible to the episcopate who was burdened with either children or
grandchildren, giving as a reason the engrossing duties of the office,
which required that the whole mind and soul should be devoted to
them, and still more significantly hinting the indecency of converting
to the use of the prelate’s family the wealth bestowed by the faithful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
on the church for pious uses and for charity.<a id="FNanchor_168_168" href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> It is probable that
this was not strictly observed, for in 535, when repeating the injunction,
and adding a restriction on conjugal intercourse, he intimates
that no inquiry shall be made into infractions previously occurring,
but that it shall be rigidly enforced for the future.<a id="FNanchor_169_169" href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> The decision
was final as regards the absence of a wife, for it was again alluded to
in 548, and that law is carried through the Nomocanon and Basilica.<a id="FNanchor_170_170" href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a>
The absence of children as a prerequisite to the episcopate, however,
was not insisted upon so pertinaciously, for Leo the Philosopher,
after the compilation of the Basilica, issued a constitution allowing
the ordination of bishops who had legitimate offspring, arguing that
brothers and other relatives were equally prone to withdraw them
from the duties of their position.<a id="FNanchor_171_171" href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is not worth while to enter into the interminable controversy
respecting the council held at Constantinople in 680, the canons of
which were promulgated in 692, and which is known to polemics as
the <i>Quinisext in Trullo</i>. The Greeks maintain that it was Œcumenic,
and its legislation binding upon Christendom; the Latins,
that it was provincial and schismatic; but whether Pope Agatho acceded
to its canons or not; whether a century later Adrian I. admitted
them, or whether their authentication by the second council of
Nicæa gave them authority over the whole church or not, are questions
of little practical importance for our purpose, for they never
were really incorporated into the law of the West, and they are only
to be regarded as forming a portion of the received ecclesiastical
jurisprudence of the East. In one sense, however, their bearing
upon the Latin church is interesting, for, in spite of them, Rome
maintained communion with Constantinople for more than a century
and a half, and the schism which then took place arose from altogether
different causes. In the West, therefore, celibacy was only a point
of discipline, of no doctrinal importance, and not a matter of heresy,
as we shall see it afterwards become under the stimulus afforded by
Protestant controversy.</p>

<p>The canons of the Quinisext are very full upon all the questions
relating to celibacy, and show that great relaxation had occurred in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
enforcing the regulations embodied in the laws of Justinian. Digami
must have become numerous in the church, for the prohibition of
their ordination is renewed, and all who had not released themselves
from such forbidden unions by June 15th of the preceding year are
condemned to suffer deposition. So marriage in orders had evidently
become frequent, for all guilty of it are enjoined to leave their wives,
when, after a short suspension, they are to be restored to their position,
though ineligible to promotion.<a id="FNanchor_172_172" href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> A much severer punishment
is, however, provided for those who should subsequently be guilty of
the same indiscretion, for all such infractions of the rule are visited
with absolute deposition<a id="FNanchor_173_173" href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a>—thus proving that it had fallen into desuetude,
since those who sinned after its restoration were regarded as
much more culpable than those who had merely transgressed an
obsolete law. Even bishops had neglected the restrictions imposed
upon them by Justinian, for the council refers to prelates in Africa,
Libya, and elsewhere, who lived openly with their wives; and
although this is prohibited for the future under penalty of deposition,
and although all wives of those promoted to the episcopate are directed
to be placed in nunneries at a distance from their husbands, yet the
remarkable admission is made that this is done for the sake of the
people, who regarded such things as a scandal, and not for the purpose
of changing that which had been ordained by the Apostles.<a id="FNanchor_174_174" href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></p>

<p>With regard to the future discipline of the great body of the
clergy, the council, after significantly acknowledging that the Roman
church required a promise of abstinence from married candidates for
the diaconate and priesthood, proceeds to state that it desires to adhere
to the Apostolic canon by keeping inviolate the conjugal relations of
those in holy orders, and by permitting them to associate with their
wives, only stipulating for continence during the time devoted to the
ministry of the sacraments. To put an end to all opposition to this
privilege, deposition is threatened against those who shall presume to
interfere between the clergy and their wives, and likewise against all
who, under pretence of religion, shall put their wives away. At the
same time, in order to promote the extension of the church, in the
foreign provinces, this latter penalty is remitted, as a concession to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
the prejudices of the “Barbarians.”<a id="FNanchor_175_175" href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> How thoroughly in some
regions sacerdotal marriage had come to be the rule we learn from a
reference to Armenia, where the Levitical custom of the Hebrews
was imitated, in the creation of a sacerdotal caste, transmitted from
father to son, and confined to the priestly houses. This limitation is
condemned by the council, which orders that all who are worthy of
ordination shall be regarded as eligible.<a id="FNanchor_176_176" href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></p>

<p>The Eastern church thus formally and in the most solemn manner
recorded its separate and independent discipline on this point, and
refused to be bound by the sacerdotalism of Rome. It thus maintained
the customs transmitted from the early period, when asceticism
had commenced to show itself, but it shrank from carrying out the
principles involved to their ultimate result, as was sternly attempted
by the inexorable logic of Rome. The system thus laid down was
permanent, for throughout the East the Quinisext was received unquestioningly
as a general council, and its decrees were authoritative
and unalterable. It is true that in the confusion of the two following
centuries a laxity of practice gradually crept in, by which those
who desired to marry were admitted to holy orders while single, and
were granted two years after ordination during which they were at
liberty to take wives, but this was acknowledged to be an abuse, and
about the year 900 it was formally prohibited by a constitution of
Leo the Philosopher.<a id="FNanchor_177_177" href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> Thus restored, the Greek church has pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>served
its early traditions unaltered to the present day. Marriage
in orders is not permitted, nor are digami admissible, but the lower
grades of the clergy are free to marry, nor are they separated from
their wives when promoted to the sacred functions of the diaconate
or priesthood. The bishops are selected from the regular clergy or
monks, and, being bound by the vow of chastity, are of course unmarried
and unable to marry. Thus the legislation of Justinian is
practically transmitted to the nineteenth century. Even this restriction
on the freedom of marriage renders it difficult to preserve the
purity of the priesthood, and the Greek church, like the Latin, is
forced occasionally to renew the Nicene prohibition against the residence
of suspected women.<a id="FNanchor_178_178" href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

<p>The strongly marked hereditary tendency, which is so distinguishing
a characteristic of mediæval European institutions has led, in
Russia at least, since the time of Peter the Great, to the customary
transmission of the priesthood, and even of individual churches, from
father to son, thus creating a sacerdotal caste. To such an extent
has this been carried that marriage is obligatory on the parish priest,
and custom requires that the wife shall be the daughter of a priest.
Some of the results of this are to be seen in a law of 1867, forbidding
for the future the aspirant to a cure from marrying the daughter
of his predecessor or undertaking to support the family of the late
incumbent as a condition precedent to obtaining the preferment. It
shows how entirely the duties of the clergy had been lost in the sense
of property and hereditary right attaching to benefices, leading inevitably
to the neglect or perfunctory performance of ecclesiastical
duties.<a id="FNanchor_179_179" href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> We shall see hereafter how narrowly the Latin church escaped
a similar transformation, and how prolonged was the struggle
to avoid it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One branch of the Eastern church, however, relaxed the rules of
the Quinisext. In 431, Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople, was
excommunicated for his heretical subtleties as to the nature of the
Godhead in Christ. Driven out from the Empire by the orthodox
authorities, his followers spread throughout Mesopotamia and Persia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
where, by the end of the century, their efforts had gradually converted
nearly the whole population. About the year 480, Barsuma,
metropolitan of Nisibi, added to his Nestorian heresy the guilt of
marrying a nun, when to justify himself he assembled a synod in
which the privilege of marriage was granted not only to priests, but
even to monks. In 485, Babueus, Patriarch of Seleucia, held a
council which excommunicated Barsuma and condemned his licentious
doctrines; but, about ten years later, a subsequent patriarch,
Babeus, in the council of Seleucia, obtained the enactment of canons
conferring the privilege of marriage on all ranks of the clergy, from
monk to patriarch. Some forty years later a debate recorded between
the Patriarch Mar Aba and King Chosroes shows that repeated marriages
were common among all orders, but Mar Aba subsequently
issued a canon depriving patriarchs and bishops of the right, and
subjecting them to the rules of the Latin and Greek churches.<a id="FNanchor_180_180" href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></p>

<p>The career of the Nestorians shows that matrimony is not incompatible
with mission-work, for they were the most successful missionaries
on record. They penetrated throughout India, Tartary, and
China. In the latter empire they lasted until the thirteenth century;
while in India they not improbably exercised an influence in modifying
the doctrines of ancient Brahmanism,<a id="FNanchor_181_181" href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> and the Portuguese discoverers
in the fifteenth century found them flourishing in Malabar.
So numerous were they that during the existence of the Latin kingdom
of Jerusalem they are described, in conjunction with the monophysite
sect of the Jacobines, as exceeding in numbers the inhabitants
of the rest of Christendom.<a id="FNanchor_182_182" href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another segment of the Eastern church may properly receive
attention here. The Abyssinians and Coptic Christians of Egypt
can scarcely in truth be considered a part of the Greek church, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
they are monophysite in belief, and have in many particulars adopted
Jewish customs, such as circumcision, &amp;c. Their observances as
regards marriage, however, tally closely with the canons of the
Quinisext, except that bishops are permitted to retain their wives.
In the sixteenth century, Bishop Zaga Zabo, who was sent as envoy
to Portugal by David, King of Abyssinia, left behind him a confession
of faith for the edification of the curious. In this document he
describes the discipline of his church as strict in forbidding the clericature
to illegitimates; marriage is not dissolved by ordination, but
second marriage, or marriage in orders, is prohibited, except under
dispensation from the Patriarch, a favor occasionally granted to magnates
for public reasons. Without such dispensation, the offender is
expelled from the priesthood, while a bishop or other ecclesiastic
convicted of having an illegitimate child is forthwith deprived of all
his benefices and possessions. Monasteries, moreover, were numerous
and monachal chastity was strictly enforced.<a id="FNanchor_183_183" href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> These rules, I
presume, are still in force. A recent traveller in those regions states
that “if a priest be married previous to his ordination, he is allowed
to remain so; but no one can marry after having entered the priesthood”—while
a mass of superstitious and ascetic observances has
overlaid religion, until little trace is left of original Christianity.<a id="FNanchor_184_184" href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>

MONACHISM.</h2>


<p>The Monastic Orders occupy too prominent a place in ecclesiastical
history, and were too powerful an instrument both for good
and evil, to be passed over without some cursory allusion, although
the secular clergy is more particularly the subject of the present
sketch, and the rise and progress of monachism is a topic too
extensive in its details to be thoroughly considered in the space
which can be allotted to it.</p>

<p>In this, as in some other forms of asceticism, we must look to
Buddhism for the model on which the Church fashioned her institutions.
Ages before the time of Sakyamuni, the life of the anchorite
had become a favorite mode of securing the <i>moksha</i>, or supreme good
of absorption in Brahma. Buddhism, in throwing open the way of
salvation to all mankind, popularized this, and thus multiplied enormously
the crowd of mendicants, who lived upon the charity of the
faithful and who abandoned all the cares and duties of life in the
hope of advancing a step in the scale of being and of ultimately
obtaining the highest bliss of admission to Nirvana. In the hopeless
confusion of Hindu chronology, it is impossible to define dates with
exactness, but we know that at a very early period these Bhikshus
and Bhikshunis, or mendicants of either sex, were organized in monasteries
(Viharas or Sangharamas) erected by the piety of the faithful,
and were subjected to definite rules, prominent among which
were those of poverty and chastity, which subsequently became the
foundation of all the Western orders. Probably the oldest existing
scripture of Buddhism is the Pratimoksha, or collection of rules for
observance by the bhikshus, which tradition, not without probability,
ascribes to Sakyamuni himself. In this, infraction of chastity falls
under the first of the four Parajika rules; it is classed, with murder,
among the most serious offences entailing excommunication and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
expulsion without forgiveness. The solicitation of a woman comes
within the scope of the thirteen Sanghadisesa rules, entailing penance
and probation, after which the offender may be absolved by an assembly
of not less than twenty bhikshus. Other punishments are
allotted for every suspicious act, and the utmost care is shown in
the regulations laid down for the minutest details of social intercourse
between the sexes.<a id="FNanchor_185_185" href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

<p>Under these rules, Buddhist monachism developed to an extent
which more than rivals that of its Western derivative. The remains
of the magnificent Viharas still to be seen in India testify at once to
the enormous multitudes which found shelter in them and to the
munificent piety of the monarchs and wealthy men who, as in Europe,
sought to purchase the favor of Heaven by founding and enlarging
these retreats for the devotee. In China, Buddhism was not introduced
until the first century A.‭D., and yet, by the middle of the
seventh century, in spite of repeated and severe persecutions, the
number of monasteries already amounted to 3716, while two hundred
years later the persecuting Emperor Wu-Tsung ordered the destruction
of no less than 4600; and at the present day it is estimated
that there are 80,000 Buddhist monks in the environs of Pekin alone.
When, in the seventh century, Hiouen-Thsang visited India, he describes
the Sangharama of Nalanda as containing ten thousand monks
and novices; and the later pilgrim, Fah-Hian, found fifty or sixty
thousand in the island of Ceylon. In the fourteenth century, the
city of Ilchi, in Chinese Tartary, possessed fourteen monasteries,
averaging three thousand devotees in each; while in Tibet, at the
present time, there are in the vicinity of Lhassa twelve great monasteries,
containing a population of 18,500 lamas. In Ladak, the
proportion of lamas to the laity is as one to thirteen; in Spiti, one
to seven; and in Burmah, one to thirty.<a id="FNanchor_186_186" href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> Great as were the proportions
to which European monachism grew, it never attained
dimensions such as these.</p>

<p>It was some time, however, before the intercourse between East
and West led to the introduction of anchoritic and monastic customs.
The first rudimentary development of a tendency in such direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
is to be found in the vows, which, as stated in a previous section,
had already, at an early period in the history of the church, become
common among female devotees. In fact an order of widows, employed
in charitable works and supported from the offerings of the
faithful, was apparently one of the primitive institutions of the
Apostles. To prevent any conflict between the claims of the world
and of the church, St. Paul directs that they shall be childless and
not less than sixty years of age, so that on the one hand there might
be no neglect of the first duty which he recognized as owing to the
family, nor, on the other hand, that the devotee should be tempted
by the flesh to quit the service which she had undertaken.<a id="FNanchor_187_187" href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></p>

<p>This admirable plan may be considered the germ of the countless
associations by which the church has in all ages earned the gratitude
of mankind by giving to Christianity its truest practical exposition.
It combined a refuge for the desolate with a most efficient organization
for spreading the faith and administering charity; and there
was no thought of marring its utility by rendering it simply an
instrument for exaggerating and propagating asceticism. St. Paul,
indeed, expressly commands the younger ones to marry and bring up
children;<a id="FNanchor_188_188" href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> and he could little have anticipated the time when this
order of widows, so venerable in its origin and labors, would, by
the caprice of ascetic progress, come to be regarded as degraded in
comparison with the virgin spouses of Christ, who selfishly endeavored
to purchase their own salvation by shunning all the duties imposed
on them by the Creator.<a id="FNanchor_189_189" href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> Nor could he have imagined that, after
eighteen centuries, enthusiastic theologians would seriously argue that
Christ and his Apostles had founded regular religious orders, bound
by the three customary vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience.<a id="FNanchor_190_190" href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<p>In the early church, as has been already shown, all vows of continence
and dedication to the service of God were a matter of simple
volition, not only as to their inception, but also as to their duration.
The male or female devotee was at liberty to return to the world and
to marry at any time;<a id="FNanchor_191_191" href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> although during the purer periods of persecution,
such conduct was doubtless visited with disapprobation and
was attended with loss of reputation. As, moreover, there was no
actual segregation from the world and no sundering of family ties,
there was no necessity for special rules of discipline. When, under
the Decian persecution, Paul the Thebæan, and shortly afterwards
St. Antony, retired to the desert in order to satisfy a craving for
ascetic mortification which could only be satiated by solitude, and
thus unconsciously founded the vast society of Egyptian cenobites,
they gave rise to what at length became a new necessity.<a id="FNanchor_192_192" href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> The
associations which gradually formed themselves required some government,
and the institution of monachism became too important a
portion of the church, both in numbers and influence, to remain long
without rules of discipline to regulate its piety and to direct its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
powers. As yet, however, a portion of the church, adhering to
ancient tradition, looked reprovingly on these exaggerated pietistic
vagaries. Lactantius, for instance, in a passage written subsequent
to the conversion of Constantine, earnestly denounces the life of a
hermit as that of a beast rather than of a man, and urges that the
bonds of human society ought not to be broken, since man cannot
exist without his fellows.<a id="FNanchor_193_193" href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></p>

<p>It was in vain to attempt to stem the tide which had now fairly
set in, nor is it difficult to understand the impulsion which drove so
many to abandon the world. No small portion of pastoral duty consisted
in exhortations to virginity, the praises of which were reiterated
with ever increasing vehemence, and the rewards of which, in
this world and the next, were magnified with constantly augmenting
promises. Indeed, a perusal of the writings of that age seems to
render it difficult to conceive how any truly devout soul could remain
involved in worldly duties and pleasures, when the abandonment of
all the ties and responsibilities imposed on man by Providence was
represented as rendering the path to heaven so much shorter and
more certain, and when every pulpit resounded with perpetual amplifications
of the one theme. Equally efficacious with the timid and
slothful was the prospect of a quiet retreat from the confusion and
strife which the accelerating decline of the empire rendered every
day wilder and more hopeless; while the crushing burdens of the
state drove many, in spite of all the efforts of the civil power, to
seek their escape in the exemptions accorded to those connected with
the church. When to these classes are added the penitents—prototypes
of St. Mary of Egypt, who retired to the desert as the only
refuge from her profligate life, and for seventeen years waged an
endless struggle with the burning passions which she could control
but could not conquer—it is not difficult to estimate how vast were
the multitudes unconsciously engaged in laying the foundations of
that monastic structure which was eventually to overshadow all
Christendom.<a id="FNanchor_194_194" href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> Indeed, even the church itself at times became
alarmed at the increasing tendency, as when the council of Saragossa,
in 381, found it necessary to denounce the practice of eccle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>siastics
abandoning their functions and embracing the monastic life,
which it assumes was done from unworthy motives.<a id="FNanchor_195_195" href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></p>

<p>Soon after his conversion, Constantine had encouraged the prevailing
tendency by not only repealing the disabilities imposed by
the old Roman law on those who remained unmarried, but by extending
the power of making wills to minors who professed the intention
of celibacy.<a id="FNanchor_196_196" href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> His piety and that of subsequent emperors speedily
attributed to all connected with the church certain exemptions from
the intolerable municipal burdens which were eating out the heart of
the empire. An enormous premium was thus offered to swell the
ecclesiastical ranks, while, as the number of the officiating clergy
was necessarily limited, the influx would naturally flow into the mass
of monks and nuns on whose increase there was no restriction, and
whose condition was open to all, with but slender examination into
the fitness of the applicant.<a id="FNanchor_197_197" href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> The rapidly increasing wealth of the
church, and the large sums devoted to the maintenance of all orders
of the clergy, offered additional temptations to those who might
regard the life of the ascetic as the means of securing an assured
existence of idleness, free from all care of the morrow. If, therefore,
during a period when ridicule and persecution were the portion of
those who vowed perpetual continence, it had been found impossible
to avoid the most deplorable scandals,<a id="FNanchor_198_198" href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> it can readily be conceived
that allurements such as these would crowd the monastic profession
with proselytes of a most questionable character, drawn from a society
so frightfully dissolute as that of the fourth century. The fierce
declamations of St. Jerome afford a terrible picture of the disorders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
prevalent among those vowed to celibacy, and of the hideous crimes
resorted to in order to conceal or remove the consequences of guilt,
showing that the asceticism enforced by Siricius had not wrought any
improvement.<a id="FNanchor_199_199" href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> The necessity of subjecting those bound by vows to
established rules must therefore have soon become generally recognized;
and although as we have already seen, they were free at any
time to abandon the profession which they had assumed, still, while
they remained as members, the welfare of the church would render
all right-minded men eager to hail any attempt to establish rules of
wholesome discipline. The first authoritative attempt to check disorders
of the kind is to be found in the first council of Carthage,
which in 348 insisted that all who, shunning marriage, elected the
better lot of chastity, should live separate and solitary, and that none
should have access to them under penalty of excommunication; and
in 381 the Council of Saragossa sought to remedy the evil at its root
by forbidding virgins to take the veil unless they could furnish proof
that they were at least forty years of age.<a id="FNanchor_200_200" href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></p>

<p>Although the church, in becoming an affair of state, had to a great
extent sacrificed its independence, still it enjoyed the countervailing
advantage of being able to call upon the temporal power for assistance
when its own authority was defied, nor was it long in requiring this
aid in the enforcement of its regulations. Accordingly, in 364, we
find a law of Jovian forbidding, under pain of actual or civil death,
any attempt to marry a sacred virgin,<a id="FNanchor_201_201" href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> the extreme severity of which
is the best indication of the condition of morals that could justify a
resort to penalties so exaggerated. How great was the necessity for
reform, and how little was actually accomplished by these attempts,
may be estimated from an effort of the Council of Valence, in 374,
to prevent those who married from being pardoned after too short a
penance,<a id="FNanchor_202_202" href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> and from the description which ten years later Pope Siricius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
gives of the unbridled and shameless license indulged in by both
sexes in violation of their monastic vows.<a id="FNanchor_203_203" href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Certain definite rules for the governance of these constantly increasing
crowds of all stations, conditions, and characters, who were
obviously so ill-fitted for the obligations which they had assumed,
became of course necessary, but it was long before they assumed an
irrevocable and binding force. The treatise which is known as the
rule of St. Oriesis is only a long and somewhat mystic exhortation
to asceticism. That which St. Pachomius is said to have received
from an angel is manifestly posterior to the date of that saint, and
probably belongs to the commencement of the fifth century. Minute
as are its instructions, and rigid as are its injunctions respecting
every action of the cenobite, yet it fully displays the voluntary
nature of the profession and the lightness of the bonds which tied
the monk to his order. A stranger applying for admission to a
monastery was exposed only to a probation of a few days, to test his
sincerity and to prove that he was not a slave; no vows were imposed,
only his simple promise to obey the rules being required. If
he grew tired of ascetic life, he departed, but he could not be again
taken back without penitence and the consent of the archimandrite.<a id="FNanchor_204_204" href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a>
Even female travellers applying for hospitality were not refused
admittance, and an inclosure was set apart for them, where they
were entertained with special honor and attention; a place was
likewise provided for them in which to be present at vespers.<a id="FNanchor_205_205" href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></p>

<p>A similar system of discipline is manifested in the detailed statement
of the regulations of the Egyptian monasteries left us by John
Cassianus, Abbot of St. Victor of Marseilles, who died in 448. No
vows or religious ceremonies were required of the postulant for
admission. He was proved by ten days’ waiting at the gate, and a
year’s probation inside, yet the slender tie between him and the community
is shown by the preservation of his worldly garments, to be
returned to him in case of his expulsion for disobedience or discon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>tent,
and also by the refusal to receive from him the gift of his
private fortune—although no one within the sacred walls was permitted
to call the simplest article his own—lest he should leave the
convent and then claim to revoke his donation, as not unfrequently
happened in institutions which neglected this salutary rule.<a id="FNanchor_206_206" href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> So, in
a series of directions for cenobitic life, appended to a curious Arabic
version of the Nicene canons, the punishment provided for persistent
disobedience and turbulence is expulsion of the offender from the
monastery.<a id="FNanchor_207_207" href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p>As a temporary refuge from the trials of life, where the soul could
be strengthened by seclusion, meditation, peaceful labor, and rigid
discipline, thousands must have found the institution of Monachism
most beneficial who had not resolution enough to give themselves up
to a life of ascetic devotion and privation. These facilities for
entrance and departure, however, only rendered more probable the
admission of the turbulent and the worldly; and the want of stringent
and effective regulations must have rendered itself every day more
apparent, as the holy multitudes waxed larger and more difficult to
manage, and as the empire became covered with wandering monks,
described by St. Augustin as beggars, swindlers, and peddlers of false
relics, who resorted to the most shameless mendacity to procure the
means of sustaining their idle and vagabond life.<a id="FNanchor_208_208" href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<p>It was this, no doubt, which led to the adoption and enforcement
of the third of the monastic vows—that of obedience—as being the
only mode by which during the period when residence was voluntary,
the crowds of devotees could be kept in a condition of subjection.
To what a length this was carried, and how completely the system of
religious asceticism succeeded in its object of destroying all human
feeling, is well exemplified by the shining example of the holy Mucius,
who presented himself for admission in a monastery, accompanied by
his child, a boy eight years of age. His persistent humility gained
for him a relaxation of the rules, and father and son were admitted
together. To test his worthiness, however, they were separated, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
all intercourse forbidden. His patience encouraged a further trial.
The helpless child was neglected and abused systematically, but all
the perverse ingenuity which rendered him a mass of filth and visited
him with perpetual chastisement failed to excite a sign of interest in
the father. Finally the abbot feigned to lose all patience with the
little sufferer’s moans, and ordered Mucius to cast him in the river.
The obedient monk carried him to the bank and threw him in with
such promptitude that the admiring spectators were barely able to
rescue him. All that is wanting to complete the hideous picture is
the declaration of the abbot that in Mucius the sacrifice of Abraham
was completed.<a id="FNanchor_209_209" href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> This epitomizes the whole system—the transfer to
man of the obedience due to God—and shows how little, by this time,
was left of the hopeful reliance on a beneficent God which distinguished
the primitive church, and which led Athenagoras, in the
second century, to argue from the premises “God certainly impels no
one to those things which are unnatural.”</p>

<p>The weaker sex, whether from the greater value attached to the
purity of woman or from her presumed frailty, as well as from some
difference in the nature of the engagement entered into, was the first
to become the subject of distinct legislation, and the frequency of the
efforts required shows the difficulty of enforcing the rule of celibacy
and chastity. Allusion has already been made to a law of Jovian
which, as early as 364, denounced the attempt to marry a nun as a
capital crime. Subsequent canons of the church show that this was
wholly ineffectual. The council of Valence, in 374, endeavored to
check such marriages. The synod of Rome, in 384, alludes with
horror to these unions, which it stigmatizes as adultery, and drawing
a distinction between virgins professed and those who had taken the
veil, it prescribes an indefinite penance before they can be received
back into the church, but at the same time it does not venture to
order their separation from their husbands.<a id="FNanchor_210_210" href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> A year later, the bolder
Siricius commands both monks and nuns guilty of unchastity to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
imprisoned, but he makes no allusion to marriage.<a id="FNanchor_211_211" href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> Notwithstanding
the fervor of St. Augustin’s admiration for virginity and the earnestness
with which he waged war in favor of celibacy, he pronounces
that the marriage of nuns is binding, ridicules those who consider it
as invalid, and deprecates the evil results of separating man and wife
under such circumstances, but yet his asceticism, satisfied with this
concession to common sense, pronounces such unions to be worse than
adulterous.<a id="FNanchor_212_212" href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> From this it is evident that these infractions of discipline
were far from uncommon, and that the stricter churchmen
already treated such marriages as null and void, which resulted in
the husbands considering themselves at liberty to marry again. Such
view of monastic vows was not sustained by the authorities of the
church, for about the same period Innocent I., like St. Augustin,
while condemning such marriages as worse than adulterous, admitted
their validity by refusing communion to the offenders until one of
the partners in guilt should be dead; and, like the synod of 384, he
considered the transgression as somewhat less culpable in the professed
virgin than in her who had consummated her marriage with
Christ by absolutely taking the veil.<a id="FNanchor_213_213" href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> It was probably this assumed
marriage with Christ—a theory which St. Cyprian shows to be as
old as the third century, and which is very strongly stated by Innocent—which
rendered the church so much more sensitive as to the
frailty of the female devotees than to that of the men. As yet,
however, the stability of such marriages was generally accepted
throughout the church, for, a few years before the epistle of Inno<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>cent
we find it enunciated by the first council of Toledo, which decided
that the nun who married was not admissible to penitence during the
life of her husband, unless she separated herself from him.<a id="FNanchor_214_214" href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></p>

<p>It is evident from all this that an effort had been made to have
such marriages condemned as invalid, and that it had failed. We
see, however, that the lines had gradually been drawn more tightly
around the monastic order, that the vows could no longer be shaken
off with ease, and that there was a growing tendency to render the
monastic character ineffaceable when once assumed. Towards the
middle of the fifth century, however, a reaction took place, possibly
because the extreme views may have been found impracticable. Thus
Leo I. treats recalcitrant cenobites with singular tenderness. He declares
that monks cannot without sin abandon their profession, and
therefore that he who returns to the world and marries must redeem
himself by penitence, for however honorable be the marriage-tie and
the active duties of life, still it is a transgression to desert the better
path. So professed virgins, who throw off the habit and marry,
violate their duty, and those who in addition to this have been regularly
consecrated commit a great crime—and yet no further punishment
is indicated for them;<a id="FNanchor_215_215" href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> and the little respect still paid to the
indelible character claimed for monachism is shown by the manner in
which the civil power was ready to interfere for the purpose of putting
an end to some of the many abuses arising from monastic institutions.
In 458 Majorian promulgated a law in which he inveighs
with natural indignation against the parents who, to get rid of their
offspring, compel their unhappy daughters to enter convents at a
tender age, and he orders that, until the ardor of the passions shall
be tempered by advancing years, no vows shall be administered.
The minimum age for taking the veil is fixed at forty years and
stringent measures are provided for insuring its observance. If infringed
by order of the parents, or by an orphan girl of her own
free will, one-third of all the possessions of the offender is confiscated
to the state, and the ecclesiastics officiating at the ceremony are
visited with the heavy punishment of proscription. A woman forced
into a nunnery, if her parents die before she reaches the age of forty,
is declared to be free to leave it and to marry, nor can she be dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>inherited
thereafter.<a id="FNanchor_216_216" href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> Fruitless as this well-intentioned effort proved,
it is highly suggestive as to the wrongs which were perpetrated under
the name of religion, the stern efforts felt to be requisite for their
prevention, and the power exercised to annul the vows.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the East, the tendency was to give a more rigid and unalterable
character to the vows, nor is it difficult to understand the cause.
Both church and state began to feel the necessity of reducing to subjection
under some competent authority the vast hordes of idle and
ignorant men who had embraced monastic life. In the West, monachism
was as yet in its infancy, and was to be stimulated rather than
to be dreaded, but it was far otherwise in the East, where the influence
of the ascetic ideas of India was much more direct and immediate.
The examples of Antony and Pachomius had brought them
innumerable followers. The solitudes of the deserts had become
peopled with vast communities, and as the contagion spread, monasteries
arose everywhere and were rapidly filled and enlarged.<a id="FNanchor_217_217" href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> The
blindly bigoted and the turbulently ambitious found a place among
those whose only aim was retirement and peace; while the authority
wielded by the superior of each establishment, through the blind
obedience claimed under monastic vows, gave him a degree of power
which rendered him not only important but dangerous. The monks
thus became in time a body of no little weight which it behooved the
church to thoroughly control, as it might become efficient for good or
evil. By encouraging and directing it, she gained an instrument of
incalculable force, morally and physically, to consolidate her authority
and extend her influence. How that influence was used, and how
the monks became at times a terror even to the state is written
broadly on the history of the age. Even early in the fifth century
the hordes of savage Nitrian cenobites were the janizaries of the
fiery Cyril, with which he lorded it over the city of Alexandria, and
almost openly bade defiance to the imperial authority. The tumult
in which Orestes nearly lost his life, the banishment of the Jews, and
the shocking catastrophe of Hypatia show how dangerous an element
to society they were even then, when under the guidance of an able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
and unscrupulous leader.<a id="FNanchor_218_218" href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> So the prominent part taken by the
monks in the deplorable Nestorian and Eutychian controversies, the
example of the Abbot Barsumas at the Robber Synod in Ephesus,
the exploits of Theodosius of Jerusalem and Peter of Antioch, who
drove out their bishops and usurped the episcopal chairs, the career
of Eutyches himself, the bloodthirsty rabble of monks who controlled
the synod of Ephesus and endeavored to overawe that of Chalcedon,
and, in the succeeding century, the insurrections against the Emperor
Anastasius which were largely attributed to their efforts—all these
were warnings not lightly to be neglected. The monks, in fact,
were fast becoming not only disagreeable but even dangerous to the
civil power; their organization and obedience to their leaders gave
them strength to seriously threaten the influence even of the hierarchy,
and the effort to keep them strictly under subjection and within their
convent walls became necessary to the peace of both church and state.</p>

<p>At the council of Chalcedon, in 451, the hierarchy had their
revenge for the insults which they had suffered two years before in
the Robber Synod. A large portion of the monks, infected with
Eutychianism, came into direct antagonism with the bishops, whom
they defied. With the aid of the civil power, the bishops triumphed,
and endeavored to put an end for the future to monastic insubordination,
by placing the monasteries under the direct control and supervision
of the secular prelates. A series of canons was adopted which
declared that monks and nuns were not at liberty to marry; but
while excommunication was the punishment provided for the offence,
power was given to the bishops to extend mercy to the offenders.
At the suggestion of the Emperor Marcian, the council deplored the
turbulence of the monks who, leaving their monasteries, stirred up
confusion everywhere, and it commanded them to devote themselves
solely to prayer and fasting in the spot which they had chosen as a
retreat from the world. It forbade them to abandon the holy life to
which they had devoted themselves, and pronounced the dread sentence
of the anathema on the renegades who refused to return and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
undergo due penance. No monastery was to be founded without the
license of the bishop of the locality, and he alone could give permission
to a monk to leave it for any purpose.<a id="FNanchor_219_219" href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></p>

<p>This legislation was well adapted to the end in view, but the evil
was too deep-seated and too powerful to be thus easily eradicated.
Finding the church unable to enforce a remedy, the civil power was
compelled to intervene. As early as 390 Theodosius the Great had
ordered the monks to confine themselves strictly to deserts and solitudes.<a id="FNanchor_220_220" href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a>
Two years later he repealed this law and allowed them to
enter the cities.<a id="FNanchor_221_221" href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> This laxity was abused, and in 466 the Emperors
Leo and Anthemius issued an edict forbidding for the future all
monks to go beyond the walls of their monasteries on any pretext,
except the apocrisarii, or legal officers, on legitimate business alone,
and these were strictly enjoined not to engage in religious disputes,
not to stir up the people, and not to preside over assemblages of any
nature.<a id="FNanchor_222_222" href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></p>

<p>History shows us how little obedience this also received, nor is it
probable that much more attention was paid to the imperial rescript
when, in 532, Justinian confirmed the legislation of his predecessors,
and added provisions forbidding those who had once taken the vows
from returning to the world under penalty of being handed over to
the <i>curia</i> of their municipality, with confiscation of their property,
and personal punishment if penniless.<a id="FNanchor_223_223" href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> Had the effort then been
successful, he would not have been under the necessity of renewing
it in 535 by a law making over to the monastery, by way of satisfaction
to God, the property of any monk presuming to abandon a
life of religion and returning to the cares of the world.<a id="FNanchor_224_224" href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> The prevalent
laxity of manners is further shown by another provision according
to which the monk who received orders was not allowed to
marry, even if he entered grades in which marriage was permitted
to the secular clergy, the penalty for taking a wife or a concubine
being degradation and dismissal, with incapacity for serving the
state.<a id="FNanchor_225_225" href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> Ten years later, further legislation was found necessary, and
at length the final expedient was hit upon, by which the apostate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
monk was handed over to the bishop to be placed in a monastery,
from which if he escaped again he was delivered to the secular
tribunal as incorrigible.<a id="FNanchor_226_226" href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> The trouble was apparently incurable.
Three hundred and fifty years later, Leo the Philosopher deplores it,
and orders all recalcitrant monks to be returned to their convents
as often as they may escape. As for the morals of monastic life,
it may be sufficient to refer to the regulation of St. Theodore Studita,
in the ninth century, prohibiting the entrance of even female
animals.<a id="FNanchor_227_227" href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus gradually the irrevocable nature of monastic vows became
established in the East, more from reasons of state than from ecclesiastical
considerations. In the West, matters were longer in reaching
a settlement, and the causes operating were somewhat different.
Monachism there had not become a terror to the civil power, and its
management was left to the church; yet, if its influence was insufficient
to excite tumults and seditions, it was none the less disorganized,
and its disorders were a disgrace to those on whom rested the
responsibility.</p>

<p>The Latin church was not by any means insensible to this disgrace,
nor did it underrate the importance of rendering the vows indissoluble,
of binding its servants absolutely and forever to its service,
and of maintaining its character and influence by endeavoring to
enforce a discipline that should insure purity. During the period
sketched above, and for the two following centuries, there is scarcely
a council which did not enact canons showing at once the persistent
effort to produce these results and the almost insurmountable difficulty
of accomplishing them. It would lead us too far to enter
upon the minutiæ of these perpetually reiterated exhortations and
threats, or of the various expedients which were successively tried.
Suffice it to say that the end in view was never lost sight of, while
the perseverance of the wrongdoer seems to have rivalled that of the
disciplinarian. The anvil bade fair to wear out the hammer, while
the confusion and lawlessness of those dismal ages gave constantly
increasing facilities to those who desired to escape from the strictness
of the ascetic life to which they had devoted themselves. Thus arose
a crowd of vagabond monks, <i>gyrovagi</i>, <i>acephali</i>, <i>circilliones</i>, <i>sara<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>baitæ</i>,
who, without acknowledging obedience to any superior, or
having any definite place of abode, wandered over the face of the
country, claiming the respect and immunities due to a sacred calling,
for the purpose of indulging in an idle and dissolute life—vagrants
of the worst description, according to the unanimous testimony of
the ecclesiastical authorities of the period.<a id="FNanchor_228_228" href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

<p>Thus, up to the middle of the fifth century, no regular system of
discipline had been introduced in the monastic establishments of the
Latin church. About that period Cassianus, the first abbot of St.
Victor of Marseilles, wrote out, for the benefit of the ruder monasticism
of the West, the details of discipline in which he had perfected
himself among the renowned communities of the East. He deplores
the absence of any fixed rule in the Latin convents, where every
abbot governed on the plan which suited his fancy; where more
difficulty was found in preserving order among two or three monks
than the Abbot of Tabenna in the Thebaïd experienced with the
flock of five thousand committed to his single charge; and where
each individual retained his own private hoards, which were carefully
locked up and sealed to keep them from the unscrupulous covetousness
of his brethren.<a id="FNanchor_229_229" href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> How little all these efforts accomplished is
clearly manifested when, in 494, we find Gelasius I. lamenting the
incestuous marriages which were not uncommon among the virgins
dedicated to God, and venturing only to denounce excommunication
on the offenders, unless they should avert it by undergoing public
penance. As for widows who married after professing chastity, he
could indicate no earthly chastisement, but only held out to them the
prospect of eternal reward or punishment, and left it for them to
decide whether they would seek or abandon the better part.<a id="FNanchor_230_230" href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> Still,
the irrevocable nature of the vow of celibacy was so little understood
or respected that in 502 Cæsarius, who had just been translated from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
the abbacy of a monastery to the bishopric of Arles, wrote to Pope
Symmachus asking him to issue a precept forbidding marriage to
nuns, to which the pontiff promptly acceeded.<a id="FNanchor_231_231" href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></p>

<p>A new apostle was clearly needed to aid the organizing spirit of
Rome in her efforts to regulate the increasing number of devotees,
who threatened to become the worst scandal of the church, and who
could be rendered so efficient an instrument for its aggrandizement.
He was found in the person of St. Benedict of Nursia, who, about
the year 494, at the early age of sixteen, tore himself from the
pleasures of the world, and buried his youth in the solitudes of the
Latian Apennines. A nature that could wrench itself away from the
allurements of a splendid career dawning amid the blandishments of
Rome was not likely to shrink from the austerities which awe and
attract the credulous and the devout. Tempted by the Evil Spirit
in the guise of a beautiful maiden, and finding his resolution on the
point of yielding, with a supreme effort Benedict cast off his simple
garment and threw himself into a thicket of brambles and nettles,
through which he rolled until his naked body was lacerated from
head to foot. The experiment, though rude, was eminently successful;
the flesh was effectually conquered, and Benedict was never
again tormented by rebellious desires.<a id="FNanchor_232_232" href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> A light so shining was not
created for obscurity. Zealous disciples assembled around him,
attracted from distant regions by his sanctity, and after various
vicissitudes he founded the monastery of Monte Casino, on which
for a thousand years were lavished all that veneration and munificence
could accumulate to render illustrious the birthplace and
capital of the great Benedictine Order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>The rule promulgated by Benedict, which virtually became the
established law of Latin Monachism, shows the more practical character
of the western mind. Though pervaded by the austerest
asceticism, yet labor, charity, and good works occupy a much more
prominent place in its injunctions than in the system of the East.
Salvation was not to be sought simply by abstinence and mortification,
and the innate selfishness of the monastic principle was relaxed
in favor of a broader and more human view of the duties of man to
his Creator and to his fellows. This gave to the institution a firmer
hold on the affections of mankind and a more enduring vitality,
which preserved its fortunes through the centuries, in spite of innumerable
aberrations and frightful abuses.</p>

<p>Still there were as yet no irrevocable vows of poverty, chastity,
and obedience exacted of the novice. After a year of probation he
promised, before God and the Saints, to keep the Rule under pain
of damnation, and he was then admitted with imposing religious
ceremonies. His worldly garments were, however, preserved, to be
returned to him in case of expulsion, to which he was liable if incorrigibly
disobedient. If he left the monastery, or if he was ejected,
he could return twice, but after the third admission, if he again
abandoned the order, he was no longer eligible.<a id="FNanchor_233_233" href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> Voluntary submission
was thus the corner-stone of discipline, and there was nothing
indelible in the engagement which bound the monk to his brethren.</p>

<p>Contemporary with St. Benedict was St. Cæsarius of Arles, whose
Rule has been transmitted to us by his nephew, St. Tetradius. It
is very short, but is more rigid than that of Benedict, inasmuch as
it requires from the applicant the condition of remaining for life in
the convent, nor will it permit his assumption of the habit until he
shall have executed a deed bestowing all his property either on his
relatives or on the establishment of his choice, thus insuring the
rule of poverty, and depriving him of all inducement to retire.<a id="FNanchor_234_234" href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></p>

<p>The Rule of St. Benedict, however, overcame all rivalry, and was
at length universally adopted; Charlemagne, indeed, inquired in 811
whether there could be any monks except those who professed obedience
to it.<a id="FNanchor_235_235" href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> Under it were founded the innumerable monasteries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
which sprang up in every part of Europe, and were everywhere the
pioneers of civilization; which exercised a more potent influence in
extending Christianity over the Heathen than all other agencies
combined; which carried the useful arts into barbarous regions, and
preserved to modern times whatever of classic culture has remained
to us. If they were equally efficient in extending the authority of
the Roman curia, and in breaking down the independence of local
and national churches, it is not to be rashly assumed that even that
result was a misfortune, when the anarchical tendencies of the Middle
Ages were to be neutralized principally by the humanizing force of
religion, and consolidation was requisite to carry the church through
the wilderness. Until the thirteenth century the Benedictines were
practically without rivals, and their numbers and holiness may be
estimated by the fact that in the fifteenth century one of their historians
computed that the order had furnished fifty-five thousand five
hundred and five blessed members to the calendar of saints.<a id="FNanchor_236_236" href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></p>

<p>Yet it could not but be a scandal to all devout minds that a man
who had once devoted himself to religious observances should return
to the world. Not only did it tend to break down the important distinction
now rapidly developing itself between the clergy and the
laity, but the possibility of such escape interfered with the control of
the church over those who formed so large a class of its members, and
diminished their utility in aiding the progress of its aggrandizement.
We cannot be surprised, therefore, that within half a century after
the death of St. Benedict, among the reforms energetically inaugurated
by St. Gregory the Great, in the first year of his pontificate,
was that of commanding the forcible return of all who abandoned
their profession—the terms of the decretal showing that no concealment
had been thought necessary by the renegades in leading a
secular life and in publicly marrying.<a id="FNanchor_237_237" href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> Equally determined were his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
efforts to reform the abuses which had so relaxed the discipline of
some monasteries that women were allowed perfect freedom of access,
and the monks contracted such intimacy with them that they openly
acted as godfathers to their children;<a id="FNanchor_238_238" href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> and when, in 601, he learned
that the monks of St. Vitus, on Mount Etna, considered themselves
at liberty to marry, apparently without leaving their convent, he
checked the abuse by the most prompt and decided commands to the
ecclesiastical authorities of Sicily.<a id="FNanchor_239_239" href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></p>

<p>By the efforts of Gregory the monk was thus, in theory at least,
separated irrevocably from the world, and committed to an existence
which depended solely upon the church. Cut off from family and
friends, the door closed behind him forever, and his only aspirations,
beyond his own personal wants and hopes, could but be for his abbey,
his order, or the church, with which he was thus indissolubly connected.
There was one exception, however, to this general rule.
No married man was allowed to become a monk unless his wife
assented, and likewise became a nun. The marriage-tie was too
sacred to be broken, unless both parties agreed simultaneously to
embrace the better life. Thus, on the complaint of a wife, Gregory
orders her husband to be forcibly removed from the monastery which
he had entered and to be restored to her. We shall see hereafter
how entirely the church in time outgrew these scruples, and how insignificant
the sacrament of marriage became in comparison with that
of ordination or the vow of religion.<a id="FNanchor_240_240" href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></p>

<p>The theory of perpetual segregation from the world was thus established,
and it accomplished at last the objects for which it was
designed, but it was too much in opposition to the invincible tendencies
of human nature to be universally enforced without a struggle which
lasted for nearly a thousand years. To follow out in detail the
vicissitudes of this struggle would require too much space. Its
nature will be indicated by occasional references in the following
pages, and meanwhile it will be sufficient to observe how little was accomplished
even in his own age by the energy and authority of
Gregory. It was only a few years after his death that the council of
Paris, in 615, proves to us that residence in monasteries was not con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>sidered
necessary for women who took the vows, and that the civil
power had to be invoked to prevent their marriage.<a id="FNanchor_241_241" href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> Indeed, it was
not uncommon for men to turn their houses, nominally at least, into
convents, living there surrounded with their wives and families, and
deriving no little worldly profit from the assumption of superior piety,
to the scandal of the truly religious.<a id="FNanchor_242_242" href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> St. Isidor of Seville, about
the same period, copies the words of St. Augustin in describing the
wandering monastic impostors who lived upon the credulous charity
of the faithful;<a id="FNanchor_243_243" href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> and he also enlarges upon the disgraceful license of
the <i>acephali</i>, or clerks bound by no rule, whose vagabond life and
countless numbers were an infamy to the western kingdoms which
they infested.<a id="FNanchor_244_244" href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> The quotation of this passage by Louis-le-Débonnaire,
in his attempt to reform the church, shows that these degraded
vagrants continued to flourish unchecked in the ninth century;<a id="FNanchor_245_245" href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> and,
indeed, Smaragdus, in his Commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict,
assures us that the evil had rather increased than diminished.<a id="FNanchor_246_246" href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Monachism was but one application of the doctrine of justification
by works, which, by the enthusiasm and superstition of ages, was
gradually built into a vast system of sacerdotalism. Through it
were eventually opened to the mediæval church sources of illimitable
power and wealth by means of the complicated machinery of purgatory,
masses for the dead, penances, indulgences, &amp;c., under the sole
control of the central head, to which were committed the power of
the keys and the dispensation of the exhaustless treasure of salvation
bestowed on the church by the Redeemer and perpetually increased
by the merits of the saints. To discuss these collateral themes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
however, would carry us too far from our subject, and I must dismiss
them with the remark that at the period now under consideration
there could have been no anticipation of these ulterior advantages
to be gained by assuming to regulate the mode in which individual
piety might seek to propitiate an offended God. Sufficient motives
for the assumption existed in the evils and aspirations of the moment
without anticipating others which only received their fullest development
under the skilful logic of the Thomists.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII">VIII.</a><br />

THE BARBARIANS.</h2>


<p>While the Latin church had thus been engaged in its hopeless
combat with the incurable vices of a worn-out civilization, it had
found itself confronted by a new and essentially different task. The
Barbarians who wrenched province after province from the feeble
grasp of the Cæsars had to be conquered, or religion and culture
would be involved in the wreck which blotted out the political system
of the Empire. The destinies of the future hung trembling in
the balance, and it might not be an uninteresting speculation to consider
what had been the present condition of the world if Western
Europe had shared the fate of the East, and had fallen under the
domination of a race bigoted in its own belief and incapable of
learning from its subjects. Fortunately for mankind, the invaders
of the West were not semi-civilized and self-satisfied; their belief
was not a burning zeal for a faith sufficiently elevated to meet many
of the wants of the soul; they were simple barbarians, who, while
they might despise the cowardly voluptuaries on whom they trampled,
could not fail to recognize the superiority of a civilization awful
even in its ruins. Fortunately, too, the Latin church was a more
compact and independently organized body than its Eastern rival,
inspired by a warmer faith and a more resolute ambition. It faced
the difficulties of its new position with consummate tact and tireless
energy; and whether its adversaries were Pagans like the Franks, or
Arians like the Goths and Burgundians, by alternate pious zeal and
artful energy it triumphed where success seemed hopeless, and where
bare toleration would have appeared a sufficient victory.</p>

<p>While the celibacy, which bound every ecclesiastic to the church
and dissevered all other ties, may doubtless be credited with a leading
share in this result, it introduced new elements of disorder where
enough existed before. The chaste purity of the Barbarians at their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
advent aroused the wondering admiration of Salvianus, as that of
their fathers four centuries earlier had won the severe encomium of
Tacitus;<a id="FNanchor_247_247" href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> but the virtue which sufficed for the simplicity of the
German forests was not long proof against the allurements accumulated
by the cynicism of Roman luxury. At first the wild converts,
content with the battle-axe and javelin, might leave the holy functions
of religion to their new subjects, their strength scarcely feeling the
restraint of a faith which to them was little more than an idle ceremony;
but as they gradually settled down in their conquests, and
recognized that the high places of the church conferred riches, honor,
and power, they coveted the prizes which were too valuable to be
monopolized by an inferior race. Gradually the hierarchy thus became
filled with a class of warrior bishops, who, however efficient in
maintaining and extending ecclesiastical prerogatives, were not likely
to shed lustre on their order by the rigidity of their virtue, or to
remove, by a strict enforcement of discipline, the scandals inseparable
from endless civil commotions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Reference has been made above (p. 80), to the perpetual iteration
of the canon of celibacy, and of the ingenious devices to prevent its
violation, by the numerous councils held during this period, showing
at once the disorders which prevailed among the clergy and the
fruitlessness of the effort to repress them. The history of the time
is full of examples illustrating the various phases of this struggle.</p>

<p>The episcopal chair, which at an earlier period had been filled by
the votes of the people, and which subsequently came under the
control of the Papacy, was at this time a gift in the hands of the
untamed Merovingians, who carelessly bestowed it on him who could
most lavishly fill the royal coffers, or who had earned it by courtly
subservience or warlike prowess. The supple Roman or the turbulent
Frank, who perchance could not recite a line of the Mass, thus
leaped at once from the laity through all the grades;<a id="FNanchor_248_248" href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> and as he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
most probably married, there can be no room for surprise if the rule
of continence, thus suddenly assumed from the most worldly motives,
should often prove unendurable. Even in the early days of the
Frankish conquest we see a cultured noble, like Genebaldus, married
to the niece of St. Remy, when placed in the see of Laon ostensibly
putting his wife away and visiting her only under pretext of religious
instruction, until the successive births of a son and a daughter—whom
he named Latro and Vulpecula in token of his sin—and we
may not unreasonably doubt the chronicler’s veracity when he informs
us that the remorse of Genebaldus led him to submit to seven years’
imprisonment as an expiatory penance.<a id="FNanchor_249_249" href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> Equally instructive is the
story of Felix of Nantes, whose wife, banished from his bed on his
elevation to the episcopate, rebelled against the separation, and, finding
him obdurate to her allurements, was filled with jealousy, believing
that only another attachment could account for his coldness.
Hoping to detect and expose his infidelity, she stole into the chamber
where he was sleeping and saw on his breast a lamb, shining with
heavenly light, indicative of the peaceful repose which had replaced
all earthly passions in his heart.<a id="FNanchor_250_250" href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> A virtue which was regarded as
worthy of so miraculous a manifestation must have been rare indeed
among the illiterate and untutored nominees of a licentious court,
and that it was so in fact is indicated by the frequent injunctions of
the councils that bishops must regard their wives as sisters; while a
canon promulgated by the council of Macon, in 581, ordering that
no woman should enter the chamber of a bishop without two priests,
or at least two deacons, in her company, shows how little hesitation
there was in publishing to the world the suspicions that were generally
entertained.<a id="FNanchor_251_251" href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> How the rule was sometimes obeyed by the wild
prelates of the age, while trampling upon other equally well-known
canons, is exemplified by the story of Macliaus of Britanny. Chanao,
Count of Britanny, had made way with three of his brothers; the
fourth, Macliaus, after an unsuccessful conspiracy, sought safety in
flight, entered the church, and was created Bishop of Vannes. On
the death of Chanao, he promptly seized the vacant throne, left the
church, threw off his episcopal robes, and took back to himself the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
wife whom he had quitted on obtaining the see of Vannes—for all
of which he was duly excommunicated by his brother prelates.<a id="FNanchor_252_252" href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></p>

<p>When such was the condition of morals and discipline in the high
places of the church, it is not to be wondered at if the second council
of Tours, in 567, could declare that the people suspect, not indeed
all, but many of the arch-priests, vicars, deacons, and subdeacons, of
maintaining improper relations with their wives, and should command
that no one in orders should visit his own house except in
company with a subordinate clerk, without whom, moreover, he was
never to sleep; the clerk refusing the performance of the duty to be
whipped, and the priest neglecting the precaution to be deprived of
communion for thirty days. Any one in orders found with his wife
was to be excommunicated for a year, deposed, and relegated among
the laity; while the arch-priest who neglected the enforcement of
these rules was to be imprisoned on bread and water for a month.
An equally suggestive illustration of the condition of society is
afforded by another canon, directed against the frequent marriages of
nuns, who excused themselves on the ground that they had taken the
veil to avoid the risk of forcible abduction. Allusion is made to the
laws of Childebert and Clotair, maintained in vigor by Charibert,
punishing such attempts severely, and girls who anticipate them are
directed to seek temporary asylum in the church until their kindred
can protect them under the royal authority, or find husbands for them.<a id="FNanchor_253_253" href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Morals were even worse among the Arian Wisigoths of Spain than
among the orthodox believers of France. It is true that priestly
marriage formed no part of the Arian doctrines, but as the heresy
originated prior to the council of Nicæa, and professed no obedience to
that or any other council or decretal, its practice in this respect was
left to such influence as individual asceticism might exercise. Having
no acknowledged head to promulgate general canons or to insist upon
their observance, no rule of the kind, even if theoretically admitted,
could be effectually enforced. How little, indeed, the rule was
obeyed is shown by the proceedings of the third council of Toledo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
held in 589 to confirm the reunion of the Spanish kingdom with the
orthodox church. It complains that even the converted bishops,
priests, and deacons are found to be publicly living with their wives,
which it forbids for the future under threat of degrading all recalcitrants
to the rank of lector.<a id="FNanchor_254_254" href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> The conversion of the kingdom to
Catholicism did not improve matters. The clergy continued not only
to associate with their wives, but also to marry openly, for the secular
power was soon afterwards forced to interfere, and King Recared I.
issued a law directing that any priest, deacon, or subdeacon connecting
himself with a woman by marriage or otherwise, should be separated
from his guilty consort by either the bishop or judge, and be
punished according to the canons of the church, while the unfortunate
woman was subjected to a hundred lashes and denied all access to
her husband. To insure the enforcement of the edict, the heavy mulct
of two pounds of gold was levied on any bishop neglecting his duty
in the premises.<a id="FNanchor_255_255" href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> Recared also interposed to put a stop to the frequent
marriages of nuns, whose separation from their husbands and
condign punishment were decreed, with the enormous fine of five
pounds of gold exacted of the careless ecclesiastic who might neglect
to carry the law into effect—a fair measure of the difficulties experienced
in enforcing the rule of celibacy.<a id="FNanchor_256_256" href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> This legislation had little
effect, for a half century later the eighth council of Toledo, in 653,
shows us that all ranks of the clergy, from bishops to subdeacons,
had still no scruple in publicly maintaining relations with wives and
concubines;<a id="FNanchor_257_257" href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> and, despite these well-meant efforts, clerical morals
went from bad to worse until the licentious reign of King Witiza
broke down all the accustomed barriers. According to the monkish
chroniclers, that reckless prince issued, in 706, a law authorizing not
only polygamy but unlimited concubinage to both laity and clergy;
a privilege of which it is not unreasonable, from what we have seen,
to suppose that they largely availed themselves.<a id="FNanchor_258_258" href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> There seems to be
no record of any remonstrance on the part of the Gothic prelates,
and when, three years later, Pope Constantine took cognizance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
innovation, and threatened Witiza with dethronement if he should
not abrogate his iniquitous legislation, the monarch retorted with a
promise to repeat the exploits of his predecessor Alaric, in sacking
and plundering the Apostolic city. It is a little singular, however,
that one of the first acts of the usurper, Don Roderic, in 711, was
the repeal of this obnoxious law.<a id="FNanchor_259_259" href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> If he had any intentions of
undertaking the reform of his subjects’ morals, however, his adventure
with Count Julian’s daughter and the Saracenic invasion caused its
indefinite postponement.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Italy was almost equally far removed from the ideal purity of
Jerome and Augustin. In the early part of the sixth century was
fabricated an account of a supposititious council, said to have been
held in Rome by Silvester I., and the neglect of celibacy is evident
when it was felt to be necessary to insert in this forgery a canon
forbidding marriage to priests, under penalty of deprivation of functions
for ten years.<a id="FNanchor_260_260" href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> Even in this it is observable that there was no
thought of annulling the marriage, as subsequently became established
in orthodox doctrines. Nothing can be more suggestive of the
demoralization of the Italian church than the permission granted
about the year 580 by Pelagius II. for the elevation to the diaconate
of a clerk at Florence, who while a widower had had children by a
concubine. What renders the circumstance peculiarly significant is
the fact that the Pope pleads the degeneracy of the age as his apology
for this laxity.<a id="FNanchor_261_261" href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such was the condition of the Christian world when Gregory the
Great, in 590, ascended the pontifical throne. He was too devout a
churchman and too sagacious a statesman not to appreciate thoroughly
the importance of the canon in all its various aspects—not only as
necessary to ecclesiastical purity according to the ideas of the age,
but also as a prime element in the influence of the church over the
minds of the people, as well as an essential aid in extending ecclesiastical
power, and in retaining undiminished the enormous possessions
acquired by the church through the munificence of the pious. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
prevailing laxity, indeed, was already threatening serious dilapidation
of the ecclesiastical estates and foundations. How clearly this was
understood is shown by Pelagius I. in 557, when he refused for a
year to permit the consecration of a bishop elected by the Syracusans.
On their persisting in their choice he wrote to the Patrician Cethegus,
giving as the reason for his opposition the prelate’s wife and children,
by whom, if they survive, the substance of the church is wont to be
jeopardized;<a id="FNanchor_262_262" href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> and his consent was finally given only on the condition
that the bishop elect should provide competent security against any
conversion of the estate of the diocese for the benefit of his family,
a detailed statement of the property being made out in advance to
guard against attempted infractions of the agreement. That this
was not a merely local abuse is evident from a law of the Wisigoths,
which provides that on the accession of any bishop, priest, or deacon,
an accurate inventory of all church possessions under his control
shall be made by five freemen, and that after his death an inquest
shall be held for the purpose of making good any deficiencies out of
the estate of the decedent, and forcing the restoration of anything
that might have been alienated.<a id="FNanchor_263_263" href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></p>

<p>There evidently was ample motive for a thorough reformation,
and Gregory accordingly addressed himself energetically to the
work of enforcing the canons. In his decretals there are numerous
references to the subject, showing that he lost no opportunity of
reviving the neglected rules of discipline regarding the ordination of
digami,<a id="FNanchor_264_264" href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> the residence of women, and abstinence from all intercourse
with the sex.<a id="FNanchor_265_265" href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> In his zeal he even went so far as to decree that any
one guilty of even a single lapse from virtue should be forever
debarred from the ministry of the altar<a id="FNanchor_266_266" href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a>—a law nullified by its own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
severity, which rendered its observance impossible. In 587, his
predecessor Pelagius had ordered that in Sicily the Roman rule
should be followed of separating subdeacons from their wives, but it
appeared cruel to Gregory that this should be enforced on those who
had no warning of such rigor when accepting the subdiaconate, and
one of the earliest acts of his pontificate was to allow them to resume
relations with their wives; but he ordered that they should abstain
from all service of the altar, and that in future no one should be
admitted to that grade who would not formally take a vow of continence.<a id="FNanchor_267_267" href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a>
There is not much trace in contemporary history of any
improvement resulting from these efforts, and towards the very close
of his pontificate, in 602, we find him entreating Queen Brunhilda
to exercise her power in restraining the still unbridled license of the
Frankish clergy—a task which he assures her is essential if she
desires to transmit her possessions in peace to her posterity.<a id="FNanchor_268_268" href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> He
also endeavored to reform the perennial abuse of the residence of
women, a reform which the church has been vainly attempting ever
since the canon of Nicæa.<a id="FNanchor_269_269" href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> That Gregory’s zeal, however, exercised
some influence is manifested by the fact that tradition in the Middle
Ages occasionally associated his name with the introduction of celibacy
in the church. The impression which he produced is shown by
the wild legend which relates that, soon after issuing and strictly
enforcing a decretal on the subject, he happened to have his fishponds
drawn off, when the heads of no less than six thousand infants
were found in them—the offspring of ecclesiastics, destroyed to avoid
detection—which filled him with so much horror that he abandoned
the vain attempt.<a id="FNanchor_270_270" href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> Yet in Italy the residence of wives was still
permitted to those in orders, under the restriction that they should
be treated as sisters;<a id="FNanchor_271_271" href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> and Gregory relates as worthy of all imitation
the case of a holy priest of Nursia who, following the example of
the saints in depriving himself of even lawful indulgences, had persistently
relegated his wife to a distance. When at length he lay on
his death-bed, to all appearance inanimate, the wife came to bid him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
a last farewell, and placed a mirror to his lips, to see whether life
was yet extinct. Her kindly ministrations roused the dominant
asceticism in his expiring soul, and he gathered strength enough to
exclaim, “Woman, depart! Take away the straw, for there is yet
fire here”—which supreme effort of self-immolation procured him
on the instant a beatific vision of St. Peter and St. Paul, during
which he lapsed ecstatically into eternity.<a id="FNanchor_272_272" href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></p>

<p>In considering so thoroughly artificial a system of morality, it is
perhaps scarcely worth while to inquire into the value of a virtue
which could only be preserved by shunning temptation with so
scrupulous a care.</p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX">IX.</a><br />

THE CARLOVINGIANS.</h2>


<p>Even the energy and authority of Gregory the Great were powerless
to restore order in the chaos of an utterly demoralized society.
In Spain, the languishing empire of the Wisigoths was fast sinking
under the imbecility which invited the easy conquest of the Saracens.
In France, Brunhilda and Fredegonda were inflaming the fierce contentions
which eventually destroyed the Merovingian dynasty, and
which abandoned the kingdom at once to the vices of civilization
and the savage atrocities of barbarism.<a id="FNanchor_273_273" href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> In Italy, the Lombards,
more detested than any of their predecessors, by their ceaseless ravages
made the Ostrogothic rule regretted, and gleaned with their
swords such scanty remnants of plunder as had escaped the hordes
which had successively swept from the gloomy forests of the North
across the rich valleys and fertile plains of the mistress of the world.
Anarchy and confusion everywhere scarce offered a field for the
exercise of the humbler virtues, nor could the church expect to
escape the corruption which infected every class from which she
could draw her recruits. Still, amid the crowd of turbulent and
worldly ecclesiastics, whose only aim was the gratification of the
senses or the success of criminal ambition, some holy men were to
be found who sought the mountain and forest as a refuge from the
ceaseless and all-pervading disorder around them. St. Gall and St.
Columba, Willibrod and Boniface, were types of these. Devoted to
the severest asceticism, burying themselves in the wilderness and
subsisting on such simple fare as the labor of their hands could
wring from a savage land, the selfishness of the anchorite did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
extinguish in them the larger aims of the Christian, and by their
civilizing labors among the heathen they proved themselves worthy
disciples of the Apostles.</p>

<p>Thicker grew the darkness as Tarik drove the Gothic fugitives
before him on the plains of Xeres, and as the house of Pepin d’Heristel
gradually supplanted the long-haired descendants of Clovis.
The Austrasian Mayors of the Palace had scanty reverence for mitre
and crozier, and it is a proof how little hold the clergy had earned
upon the respect and affection of the people, when the usurpers in
that long revolution did not find it necessary to conciliate their support.
In fact, the policy of those shrewd and able men was rather
to oppress the church and to parcel out its wealth and dignities
among their warriors, who made no pretence of piety nor deigned
to undertake the mockery of religious duties. Rome could interpose
no resistance to these abuses, for, involved alternately in strife with
the Lombards and the Iconoclastic Emperors, the Popes implored
the aid of the oppressor himself, and were in no position to protest
against the aggressions which he might commit at home.</p>

<p>In Italy, the condition of discipline may be inferred from the fact
that, in 721, Gregory II. considered it necessary to call a synod for
the special purpose of condemning incestuous unions and the marriages
of nuns, which he declared were openly practised,<a id="FNanchor_274_274" href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> and the
canons then promulgated received so little attention that they had to
be repeated by another synod in 732.<a id="FNanchor_275_275" href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> In fact, the vow of chastity
was frequently taken by widows that they might escape a second
marriage and thus be able to live in shameless license without being
subject to the watchful control of a husband, and an edict of Arechis
Duke of Beneventum about the year 774 orders that all such godless
women shall be seized and shut up in convents.<a id="FNanchor_276_276" href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> That the secular
clergy should consider ordination no bar to matrimony need therefore
excite little surprise. There is extant a charter of Talesperianus,
Bishop of Lucca, in 725, by which he confirms a little monastery
and hospital to Romuald the priest and his wife—“presbiteria sua.”
The document recites that this couple had come on a pilgrimage from
beyond the Po; that they had settled in the lands of the Convent of
St. Peter and St. Martin in the diocese of Lucca, where they had
bought land and built the institution which the good bishop thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
confirms to them with certain privileges. He evidently felt that
there was nothing irregular in their maintaining the connection, and
he lays upon them no conditions of separation.<a id="FNanchor_277_277" href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></p>

<p>In France, it may be readily believed that discipline was even
more neglected. For eighty years scarce a council was held; no
attempts were made to renew or enforce the rules of discipline, and
the observances of religion were at length well-nigh forgotten. In
726, Boniface even felt scruples as to associating in ordinary intercourse
with men so licentious and depraved as the Frankish bishops
and priests, and he applied to Gregory II. for the solution of his
doubts. Gregory, in reply, ordered him to employ argument in
endeavoring to convince them of their errors, and by no means to
withdraw himself from their society,<a id="FNanchor_278_278" href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> a politic toleration of vice contrasting
strangely with his fierce defiance of the iconoclastic heresy
of Leo the Isaurian, when he risked the papacy itself in his eagerness
to preserve his beloved images.</p>

<p>When, however, the new dynasty began to assume a permanent
position, it sought to strengthen itself by the influence of the church.
Like the modern Charlemagne, it saw in a restoration of religion a
means of assuring its stability by linking its fortunes with those of
the hierarchy. A radical in opposition becomes of necessity a conservative
in power; and the arts which had served to supplant the
hereditary occupants of the throne were no longer advisable after
success had indicated a new line of policy. As Clovis embraced
Christianity in order to consolidate his conquests into an empire, so
Carloman and Pepin-le-Bref sought the sanction of religion to consecrate
their power to their descendants, and the Carlovingian system
thenceforth became that of law and order, organizing a firm and
settled government out of the anarchical chaos of social elements.</p>

<p>It was the pious Carloman who first saw clearly how necessary
was the aid of the church in any attempt to introduce civilization
and subordination among his turbulent subjects. Immediately on
his accession, he called upon St. Boniface to assist him in the work,
and the Apostle of Germany undertook the arduous task. How
arduous it was may be conceived from his description of the utterly
demoralized condition of the clergy, when he appealed to Pope Zachary
for advice and authority to assist in eradicating the frightful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
promiscuous licentiousness which was displayed with careless cynicism
throughout all grades of the ecclesiastical body.<a id="FNanchor_279_279" href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> The details are too
disgusting for translation, but the statement can readily be believed
when we see what manner of men filled the controlling positions in
the hierarchy.</p>

<p>Charles Martel had driven out St. Rigobert, Archbishop of Rheims,
and had bestowed that primatial see on one of his warriors named
Milo, who soon succeeded in likewise obtaining possession of the
equally important archiepiscopate of Trèves.<a id="FNanchor_280_280" href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> Milo was himself an
indication of the prevailing laxity of discipline, for he was the son
of Basinus his predecessor in the see of Trèves.<a id="FNanchor_281_281" href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> He is described
as being a clerk in tonsure, but in every other respect an irreligious
laic, yet Boniface, with all the aid of his royal patrons, was unable
to oust him from his inappropriate dignities, and in 752, ten years
after the commencement of his reforms, we find Pope Zachary, in
response to an appeal for advice, counselling him to leave Milo and
other similar wolves in sheep’s clothing to the divine vengeance.<a id="FNanchor_282_282" href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a>
Boniface, apparently, found it requisite to follow this advice and the
divine vengeance did not come until Milo had enjoyed his incongruous
dignities for forty years, when at length he was removed by an
appropriate death, received from a wild boar in hunting.<a id="FNanchor_283_283" href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> He was
only a type of many others who openly defied all attempts to remove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
them. One, who is described as “pugnator et fornicator,” gave up,
it is true, the spiritualities of his see, but held to the temporalities
with a gripe that nothing could loosen; another utterly disregarded
the excommunications launched at his head, and Zachary and Boniface
at last were fain to abandon him to his evil courses.<a id="FNanchor_284_284" href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> Somewhat
more success, indeed, he had with Gervilius, son and successor to
Geroldus, Bishop of Mainz. The latter, accompanying Carloman in
an expedition against the Saxons, was killed in battle. Bishop Gervilius,
in another foray, recognized his father’s slayer, invited him to
a friendly interview, and treacherously stabbed him, exclaiming, in
the rude poetry of the chronicler, “Accipe jam ferrum quo patrem
vindico carum.” This act of filial piety was not looked upon as
unclerical, until Boniface took it up; Gervilius was finally forced to
abandon the see of Mainz, and it was given to Boniface himself.<a id="FNanchor_285_285" href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a>
When such were the prelates, it is not to be supposed that rules of
abstinence and asceticism received much attention from their subordinates.
Boniface admits, in an epistle to King Ecgberht, that, in
consequence of the universal licentiousness, he was compelled to
restore the guilty to their functions after penitence, as the canonical
punishment of dismissal would leave none to perform the sacred
offices.<a id="FNanchor_286_286" href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> What the church, however, could not prevent on earth, it
at least had the satisfaction of seeing punished in the future life. It
was principally for the support given to Milo of Rheims among his
many other similar misdeeds, that Charles Martel was condemned to
eternal torture, which was, as a wholesome example, made manifest
to the most incredulous. St. Eucherius, in a vision, saw him plunged
into the depths of hell, and on consulting St. Boniface and Fulrad
Abbot of St. Denis, it was resolved to open Charles’s tomb. The
only tenant of the sepulchre was found to be a serpent, and the walls
were blackened as though by fire, thus proving the truth of the revelation,
and holding out an awful warning to future wrongdoers.<a id="FNanchor_287_287" href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></p>

<p>How much of the license complained of was indiscriminate concubinage,
and how much was merely intercourse with legitimate
wives, we have no means of ascertaining. The latter Boniface succeeded
in suppressing, for the church could control her sacraments.<a id="FNanchor_288_288" href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a>
The former was beyond his power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

<p>Armed with full authority from Pope Zachary, Carloman and
Boniface commenced the labor of reducing to order this chaos of
passion and license. Under their auspices a synod was held, April
23, 742, in which all unchaste priests and deacons were declared
incapable of holding benefices, were degraded and forced to do penance.
Bishops were required to have a witness to testify to the
purity of their lives and doctrines, before they could perform their
episcopal functions. For all future lapses from virtue, priests were
to be severely whipped and imprisoned for two years on bread and
water, with prolongation of the punishment at the discretion of their
bishops. Other ecclesiastics, monks, and nuns were to be whipped
thrice and similarly imprisoned for one year, besides the stigma of
having the head shaved. All monasteries, moreover, were to adopt
and follow rigidly the rule of St. Benedict.<a id="FNanchor_289_289" href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></p>

<p>The stringency of these measures shows not only the extent of
the evil requiring such means of cure, but the fixed determination
of the authorities to effect their purpose. The clergy, however, did
not submit without resistance. It is probable that they stirred up
the people, and that signs of general disapprobation were manifested
at a rigor so extreme in punishing faults which for more than two
generations had passed wholly unnoticed, for during the same year
Zachary addressed an epistle to the Franks with the object of enlisting
them in the cause. The ill-success of their arms against the Pagans
he attributes to the vices of their clergy, and he promises them that
if they show themselves obedient to Boniface, and if they can enjoy
the prayers of pure and holy priests, they shall in future have an
easy triumph over their heathen foes.<a id="FNanchor_290_290" href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> Yet many adulterous priests
and bishops, noted for the infamy of their lives, pretended that they
had received from Rome itself dispensations to continue in their
ministry—an allegation which Zachary of course repelled with
indignation.<a id="FNanchor_291_291" href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></p>

<p>Carloman, however, pursued his self-imposed task without flinching.
On March 1st, 743, he held another synod at Leptines, where the
clergy promised to observe the ancient canons, and to restore the
discipline of the church. The statutes enacted the previous year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
were again declared to be in full vigor for future offences, while for
previous ones penitence and degradation were once more decreed.<a id="FNanchor_292_292" href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">292</a></p>

<p>These regulations affected only Austrasia, the German portion of
the Frankish empire, ruled by Carloman. His brother, Pepin-le-Bref,
who governed Neustria, or France, was less pious, and had not
apparently as yet recognized the policy of reforming out of their
possessions the warrior vassals whom his father had gratified with
ecclesiastical benefices. At length, however, he was induced to lend
his aid, and in 744 he assembled a synod at Soissons for the purpose.
So completely had the discipline of the church been neglected and
forgotten, that Pepin was obliged to appeal to Pope Zachary for an
authoritative declaration as to the grades in which marriage was prohibited.<a id="FNanchor_293_293" href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">293</a>
Yet his measures were but lukewarm, for he contented
himself with simply forbidding unchastity in priests, the marriage
of nuns, and the residence of stranger women with clerks, no special
punishment being threatened, beyond a general allusion to existing
laws.<a id="FNanchor_294_294" href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></p>

<p>Thus assailed by both the supreme ecclesiastical and temporal
authorities, the clergy still were stubborn. Some defended themselves
as being legitimately entitled to have a concubine—or rather,
we may presume, a wife. Among these we find a certain Bishop
Clement described as a pestilent heresiarch, with followers who maintained
that his two children, born during his prelacy, did not unfit
him for his episcopal functions; and a synod held in Rome, October
31st, 745, was required for his condemnation, the local authorities
apparently proving powerless. Even this was not sufficient, for in
January, 747, we find Zachary directing Boniface to bring him
before a local council, and if he still proved contumacious, to refer
the matter again to Rome.<a id="FNanchor_295_295" href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> Others, again, unwilling to forego their
secular mode of existence, or to abandon the livelihood afforded by
the church, were numerous and hardy enough to ask Pepin and Carloman
to set apart for them churches and monasteries in which they
could live as they were accustomed to do. So nearly did they succeed
in this attempt, that Boniface found it necessary to appeal to
Zachary to prevent so flagrant an infraction of the canons, and
Zachary wrote to the princes with instructions as to the mode of
answering the petition.<a id="FNanchor_296_296" href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> Others, still more audacious, assailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
Boniface in every way, endeavored to weary him out, and even,
rightly regarding him as the cause of their persecution and tribulations,
made attempts upon his life.<a id="FNanchor_297_297" href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></p>

<p>That he should have escaped, indeed, is surprising, when the character
of the age is considered, and the nature of the evils inflicted
on those who must have regarded the reform as a wanton outrage on
their rights. As late as 748, Boniface describes the false bishops
and priests, sacrilegious and wandering hypocrites and adulterers, as
much more numerous than those who as yet had been forced to compliance
with the rules. Driven from the churches, but supported by
the sympathizing people, they performed their ministry among the
fields and in the cabins of the peasants, who concealed them from
the ecclesiastical authorities.<a id="FNanchor_298_298" href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> This is not a description of mere
sensual worldlings, and it is probable that by this time persecution
had ranged the evil-disposed on the winning side. Those who thus
exercised their ministry in secret and in wretchedness, retaining the
veneration of the people, were therefore men who believed themselves
honorably and legitimately married, and who were incapable
of sacrificing wife and children for worldly advantage or in blind
obedience to a rule which to them was novel, unnatural, and indefensible.</p>

<p>Boniface escaped from the vengeful efforts of those who suffered
from his zeal, to fall, in 755, under the sword of the equally ungrateful
Frisians. It is probable that up to the time of his death he
was occupied with the reformation of the clergy in conjunction with
his missionary labors, for in 752 we find him still engaged in the
hopeless endeavor to eject the unclerical prelates, who even yet
held over from the iron age of Charles Martel. His disappearance
from the scene, however, made but little change in the movement
which had owed so much to his zeal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In 747 Carloman’s pious aspirations had led him from a throne to
a cloister, and the monastery of Monte Casino welcomed its most
illustrious inmate. Pepin received the whole vast kingdom, and his
ambitious designs drew him daily closer to the church, the importance
of whose support he commenced to appreciate. His policy,
in consolidating the power of his house and in founding a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
dynasty, led him necessarily to reorganize the anarchical elements
of society. As an acknowledged monarch, a regularly constituted
hierarchy and recognized subordination to the laws, both civil and
ecclesiastical, were requisite to the success of his government and to
the establishment of his race. Accordingly, we find him carrying
out systematically the work commenced by Carloman and Boniface,
to which at first his support had been rather negative than positive.</p>

<p>Six weeks after the martyrdom of Boniface, Pepin held a synod
in his royal palace of Verneuil, in which this tendency is very apparent.
Full power was given to the bishops in their respective dioceses
to enforce the canons of the church on the clergy, the monks, and
the laity. The monasteries were especially intrusted to the episcopal
care, and means were provided for reducing the refractory to submission.
The rule of Benedict was proclaimed as in force in all
conventual establishments, and cloistered residence was strictly
enjoined. All ecclesiastics were ordered to pay implicit obedience
to their bishops, and this was secured by the power of excommunication,
which was no longer, as in earlier ages, the simple suspension
from religious privileges, but was a ban which deprived the offender
of all association with his fellows, and exposed him, if contumacious,
to exile by the secular power. By the appointment of metropolitans,
a tribunal of higher resort was instituted, while two synods to be
held each year gave the opportunity both of legislation and of final
judgment. Submission to their decisions was insured by threatening
stripes to all who should appeal from them to the royal court.<a id="FNanchor_299_299" href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></p>

<p>Such are the main features, as far as they relate to our subject, of
this Capitulary, which so strikingly reveals the organizing system of
the Carlovingian polity. Carried out by the rare intelligence and
vigor of Charlemagne, it gave a precocious development of civilization
to Europe, transitory because in advance of the age, and because
it was based on the intellectual force of the ruler, and not on the virtue
and cultivation of a people as yet too barbarous to appreciate it.</p>

<p>The organization of the church, moreover, received at the same
time an efficient impulse by the institution of the order of canons,
founded virtually in 762, the year in which St. Chrodegang, Bishop
of Metz, promulgated the Rule for their government. This Rule
of course entirely forbids all intercourse with women, and endeavors
to suppress it by punishing transgressors with stripes, incarceration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
and deposition.<a id="FNanchor_300_300" href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> The lofty rank of St. Chrodegang, who was a cousin
of Pepin-le-Bref, and the eminent piety which merited canonization,
gave him wide influence which doubtless assisted in extending the
new institution, but it also had recommendations of its own which
were sufficient to insure its success. By converting the cathedral
clergy into monks, bound by implicit obedience towards their superiors,
it brought no little increase of power to the bishops, and
enabled them to exert new authority and influence. It is no wonder
therefore that the Order spread rapidly and was adopted in most of
the dioceses.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For a century we hear nothing more of sacerdotal marriage—and
yet it may be doubted whether clerical morality had really been
improved by the well-meant reforms of Boniface. These were followed
up by Charlemagne with all his resistless energy, and the importance
which he attached to the subject is shown by an epistle of
Adrian I. denying certain assertions made to the Frankish sovereign,
inculpating the purity of the Roman clergy. Adrian, in defending
his flock, assumes that the object of the slanders can only have been
to produce a quarrel between himself and Charlemagne, who must
evidently have made strong representations on the subject to the
Pontiff.<a id="FNanchor_301_301" href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> Under such pressure perhaps there was something less of
shameless licentiousness; the episcopal chairs were no longer defiled
by the cynical lubricity of unworthy prelates; but in the mass of
the clergy the passions, deprived of all legitimate gratification, could
not be restrained in a race so little accustomed to self-control, and
unchastity remained a corroding ulcer which Charlemagne and Louis-le-Débonnaire
vainly endeavored to eradicate. The former, indeed,
we find asking in 811 whether the only difference between clerk and
layman is that the former does not bear arms and is not publicly
married;<a id="FNanchor_302_302" href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> while Ghaerbald, Bishop of Liége, a few years before had
ordered that all priests maintaining intercourse with their wives
should be deprived of their benefices and be subjected to penitence
until death.<a id="FNanchor_303_303" href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

<p>It would be an unprofitable task to recapitulate the constantly
repeated legislation prohibiting the residence of women with the
clergy and repressing the disorders and irregularities of the monastic
establishments. It would be but a reiteration of the story already
related in previous centuries, and its only importance would be in
showing by the frequency of the edicts how utterly ineffectual they
were. When Louis-le-Débonnaire, in 826, decreed<a id="FNanchor_304_304" href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> that the seduction
of a nun was to be punished by the death of both the partners
in guilt; that the property of both was to be confiscated to the
church, and that the count in whose district the crime occurred, if
he neglected its prosecution, was to be degraded, deprived of his
office, undergo public penance, and pay his full wer-gild to the fisc,
the frightful severity of the enactment is the measure of the impossibility
of effecting its purpose, and of the inefficiency of the reformation
which had been so elaborately prepared and so energetically
promulgated by Louis in 817.<a id="FNanchor_305_305" href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></p>

<p>But perhaps the most convincing evidence of the debased morality
of the clergy, and of the low standard which even the most zealous
prelates were forced to adopt, is to be found in a curious fabrication
by the authors of the False Decretals. The collection of decretals
which they put forth in the names of the early popes embodied their
conception of a perfect church establishment, as adapted to the
necessities and aspirations of the ninth century. While straining
every point to throw off all subjection to the temporal power, and to
obtain for the hierarchy full and absolute control over all ecclesiastical
matters and persons, they seem to have felt it necessary to relax
in an important point the rigor of the canons respecting sacerdotal
purity. Gregory the Great had proclaimed in the clearest and most
definite manner the rule that a single lapse from virtue condemned
the sinner to irrevocable degradation, and rendered him forever unfit
for the ministry of the altar.<a id="FNanchor_306_306" href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> Yet “Isidor Mercator” added to a
genuine epistle of Gregory a long passage elaborately arguing the
necessity of forgiveness for those who expiate by repentance the sin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
of impurity, “of which, among many, so few are guiltless.”<a id="FNanchor_307_307" href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> The
direct testimony is notable, but not less so is the indirect evidence of
the prevalent laxity which could induce such a bid for popularity on
the part of high churchmen like those concerned in the Isidorian
forgeries.</p>

<p>Evidence, also, is not wanting, that the denial of the appropriate
and healthful human affections led to the results which might be
expected of fearful and unnatural crimes. That the inmates of
monasteries, debarred from female society, occasionally abandoned
themselves to the worst excesses, or, breaking through all restraint,
indulged in less reprehensible but more open scandals, is proclaimed
by Charlemagne, who threatened to vindicate the outrage upon
religion with the severest punishment.<a id="FNanchor_308_308" href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> Nor were the female convents
more successfully regulated, for the council of Aix-la-Chapelle,
in 836, states that in many places they were rather brothels than
houses of God; and it shows how close a supervision over the spouses
of Christ was thought requisite when it proceeds to direct that nunneries
shall be so built as to have no dark corners in which scandals
may be perpetrated out of view.<a id="FNanchor_309_309" href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> The effect of these efforts may be
estimated from a remark in a collection of laws which bears the
name of Erchenbald, Chancellor of Charlemagne, but which is rather
attributable to the close of the ninth century, that the licentiousness
of nuns commonly resulted in a worse crime—infanticide;<a id="FNanchor_310_310" href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> and, as
this is extracted textually from an epistle of St. Boniface to Ethelbald,
King of Mercia,<a id="FNanchor_311_311" href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> it is presumable that the evil became notorious
simultaneously with the reform under the early Carlovingians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
and continued unabated throughout their dynasty. One device to
subjugate nature, adopted in the monasteries, was to let blood at
stated intervals, in the hope of reducing the system and thus mitigating
the effects of prolonged continence—a device prohibited by
Louis-le-Débonnaire, but long subsequently maintained as part of
monastic discipline.<a id="FNanchor_312_312" href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> As regards the secular clergy, even darker
horrors are asserted by Theodulf, Bishop of Orleans, and other prelates,
who forbade to their clergy the residence of mother, aunt, and
sister, in consequence of the crimes so frequently perpetrated with
them at the instigation of the devil;<a id="FNanchor_313_313" href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> and the truth of this hideous
fact is unfortunately confirmed by the declarations of councils held
at various periods.<a id="FNanchor_314_314" href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></p>

<p>If, under the external polish of Carlovingian civilization, such
utter demoralization existed, while the laws were enforced by the
stern vigor of Charlemagne, or the sensitive piety of Louis-le-Débonnaire,
it is easy to understand what was the condition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
society when the sons of the latter involved the whole empire in a
ceaseless tumult of civil war. Not only was the watchful care of
the first two emperors withdrawn, but the state was turned against
itself, and rapine and desolation became almost universal. The
royal power was parcelled out, by the rising feudal system, among a
crowd of nobles whose energies were solely directed to consolidating
their position, and was chiefly employed, as far as it affected the
church, in granting abbeys and other ecclesiastical dignities to worthless
laymen, whose support could only be secured by bribes which
the royal fisc could no longer supply. Pagan Danes and infidel
Saracens were ravaging the fairest provinces of the empire, and their
blows fell with peculiar weight on the representatives of a hated
religion. For seventy years previous to the treaty of Clair-sur-Epte
no mass resounded in the walls of the cathedral church of Coutances,
so fierce and unremitting had been the incursions of the Northmen.
It is therefore no wonder that, as early as 845, the bishops assembled
at the council of Vernon confess that their ecclesiastical authority is
no longer sufficient to prevent the marriage of monks and nuns and
to suppress the crowds who escaped from their convents and wandered
over the country in licentiousness and vagabondage. To
restrain these disorders they are obliged to invoke the royal power
to cast into prison these reprobates and force them to undergo
canonical penance.<a id="FNanchor_315_315" href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></p>

<p>During this period of anarchy and lawlessness, the church was
skilfully emancipating itself from subjection to the temporal power,
and was laying the foundation of that supremacy which was eventually
to dominate Christendom. While its aspirations and ambitions
were thus worldly, and its ranks were recruited from a generation
trained under such influences, it is easy to believe that the disorders
which Charlemagne himself could not repress, grew more and more
flagrant. Even the greatly augmented power of the papacy added
to the increasing license, although Nicholas I. in 861 had ordered
the deposition and degradation of all priests convicted of immorality,<a id="FNanchor_316_316" href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">316</a>
for the appellate jurisdiction claimed by Rome gave practical immunity
to those against whom the enforcement of the canons was
attempted. About the year 876, Charles-le-Chauve, in a spirited
argument against the pretensions of the popes, calls attention specially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
to the exemption thus afforded to unchaste priests, who, after due
conviction by their bishops, obtained letters from Rome overruling
the judgments; the distance and dangers of the journey precluding
the local authorities from supporting their verdicts by sending commissioners
and witnesses to carry on a second trial beyond the Alps.<a id="FNanchor_317_317" href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></p>

<p>This shows that the effort to enforce purity was not as yet abandoned,
however slender may have been the success in eradicating an
evil so general and so deeply rooted. The nominal punishment for
unchastity—loss of benefice and deposition—was severe enough to
induce the guilty to hide their excesses with care, when they chanced
to have a bishop who was zealous in the performance of his duties.
Efforts at concealment, moreover, were favored by the forms of
judicial procedure, which were such as to throw every difficulty in
the way of procuring a conviction, and to afford, in most cases,
practical immunity for sin, unless committed in the most open and
shameless manner. Hincmar, Archbishop of Rheims, the leading
ecclesiastic of his day, whose reputation for learning and piety would
have rendered him one of the lights of the church, had not his consistent
opposition to the innovations of the papacy caused his sanctity
to be questioned in Rome, has left us elaborate directions as to
the forms of prosecution in such matters. Notwithstanding his
earnest exhortations and arguments in favor of the most ascetic
purity, he discourages investigation by means of neighbors and
parishioners, or irreverent inquiries on the subject. Only such
testimony was admissible as the laws allowed, and the laws were
very strict as to the position and character of witnesses. In addition
to the accusers themselves, seven witnesses were necessary. Of
these, one was required to substantiate the oaths of the rest by undergoing
the ordeal, thus exposing himself and all his fellows to the
heavy penalties visited on perjury, upon the chance of the red-hot
iron or cold-water trial, administered, perhaps, by those interested
in shielding the guilty. If, as we can readily believe was generally
the case, these formidable difficulties could not be overcome, and the
necessary number of witnesses were not ready to sacrifice themselves,
then the accused could purge himself of the sins imputed to him by
his own oath, supported by one, three, or six compurgators of his
own order; and Hincmar himself bears testimony to the associations
which were formed among the clergy to swear each other through all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
troubles.<a id="FNanchor_318_318" href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> Even simpler, indeed, was the process prescribed not
long before by Pope Nicholas I., who ordered that when legal evidence
was not procurable, the accused priest could clear himself on
his own unsupported oath.<a id="FNanchor_319_319" href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></p>

<p>Under these regulations, Hincmar orders an annual investigation
to be made throughout his province, but the results would appear to
have been as unsatisfactory as might have been expected. In 874,
at the Synod of Rheims, he complains that his orders have been
neglected and despised, and he warns his clergy that proof of actual
criminality will not be required, but that undue familiarity with
women, if persisted in, will be sufficient for condemnation when
properly proved.<a id="FNanchor_320_320" href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></p>

<p>In the presence of facilities for escape such as were afforded by
the practice of ecclesiastical law as constructed by the decretalists,
and as expounded by Hincmar himself, the threats in which he
indulged could carry but little terror. We need not wonder, therefore,
if we meet with but slender indications of priestly marriage
during all this disorder, for there was evidently little danger of
punishment for the unchaste priest who exercised ordinary discretion
in his amours, while the penalties impending over those who should
openly brave the canonical rules were heavy, and could hardly be
avoided by any one who should dare to unite himself publicly to a
woman in marriage. Every consideration of worldly prudence and
passion therefore induced the priest to pursue a course of illicit
licentiousness—and yet, as the century wore on, traces of entire
neglect or utter contempt of the canons began to manifest themselves.
How little the rule really was respected by the ecclesiastical
authorities, when anything was to be gained by its suppression, is
shown in the decision made by Nicholas I., the highest of high
churchmen, when encouraging the Bulgarians to abandon the Greek
church, although the separation between Rome and Constantinople
was not, as yet, formal and complete. To their inquiry whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
married priests should be ejected, he replied that though such ministers
were objectionable, yet the mercy of God was to be imitated,
who causes his sun to shine on good and evil alike, and as Christ
did not dismiss Judas, so they were not to be dismissed. Besides,
laymen were not to judge priests for any crime, nor to make any
investigation into their lives, such inquiries being reserved for bishops.<a id="FNanchor_321_321" href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">321</a>
As no bishops had yet been appointed by Rome, the answer was a
skilfully tacit permission of priestly marriage, while avoiding an
open avowal.</p>

<p>It need awaken no surprise if those who united recklessness and
power should openly trample on the canons thus feebly supported.
A somewhat prominent personage of the period was Hubert, brother
of Teutberga, Queen of Lotharingia, and his turbulent conduct was
a favorite theme for animadversion by the quiet monastic chroniclers.
That he was an abbot is perhaps no proof of his clerical profession,
but when we find his wife and children alluded to as a proof of his
abandoned character, it shows that he was bound by vows or ordained
within the prohibited grades, and that he publicly violated the rules
and defied their enforcement.<a id="FNanchor_322_322" href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></p>

<p>The earliest absolute evidence that has reached us, however, of
marriage committed by a member of the great body of the plebeian
clergy, subsequent to the reforms of Boniface, occurs about the year
893. Angelric priest of Vasnau appealed to the synod of Chalons,
stating that he had been publicly joined in wedlock to a woman
named Grimma. Such an attempt by a priest, the consent of the
woman and her relatives, and the performance of the ceremony by
another priest all show the prevailing laxity and ignorance, yet still
there were found some faithful and pious souls to object to the transaction,
and Angelric was not allowed to enjoy undisturbed the fruits
of his sin. Yet even the synod was perplexed, and unable to decide
what ought to be done. It therefore only temporarily suspended
Angelric from communion, while Mancio, his bishop, applied for
advice to Foulques of Rheims, metropolitan of the province, and the
ignorance and good faith of all parties are manifested by the fact
that Angelric himself was sent to Foulques as the bearer of the letter
of inquiry.<a id="FNanchor_323_323" href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">323</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>With the ninth century the power, the cultivation, and the civilization
of the Carlovingians may be considered virtually to disappear,
though for nearly a hundred years longer a spectral crown encircled
the brows of the ill-starred descendants of Pepin. Centralization,
rendered impossible in temporal affairs by feudalism, was transferred
to the church, which, thenceforth, more than ever independent of
secular control, became wholly responsible for its own shortcomings;
and the records of the period make only too plainly manifest how
utterly the power, so strenuously contended for, failed to overcome
the ignorance and the barbarism of the age.</p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X">X.</a><br />

THE TENTH CENTURY.</h2>


<p>The tenth century, well characterized by Cave as the “Sæculum
Obscurum,” is perhaps the most repulsive in Christian annals. The
last vestiges of Roman culture have disappeared, while the dawn of
modern civilization is as yet far off. Society, in a state of transition,
is painfully and vainly seeking some form of security and stability.
The marauding wars of petty neighboring chiefs become the normal
condition, only interrupted when two or three unite to carry destruction
to some more powerful rival. Though the settlement of Normandy
relieved Continental Europe to a great extent from the terror
of the Dane, yet the still more dreaded Hun took his place and
ravaged the nations from the Danube to the Atlantic, while England
bore the undivided fury of the Vikings, and the Saracen left little to
glean upon the shores of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>When brutal ignorance and savage ferocity were the distinguishing
characteristics of the age, the church could scarce expect to escape
from the general debasement. It is rather a matter of grateful surprise
that religion itself was not overwhelmed in the general chaos
which engulfed almost all previously existing institutions. When
the crown of St. Peter became the sport of barbarous nobles, or of a
still more barbarous populace, we may grieve, but we cannot affect
astonishment at the unconcealed dissoluteness of Sergius III., whose
bastard, twenty years later, was placed in the pontifical chair by the
influence of that embodiment of all possible vices, his mother Marozia.<a id="FNanchor_324_324" href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">324</a>
The last extreme of depravity would seem attained by John
XII., but as his deposition in 963 by Otho the Great loosened the
tongues of his accusers, it is possible that he was no worse than some
of his predecessors. No extreme of wickedness was beyond his
capacity; the sacred palace of the Lateran was turned into a brothel;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
incest gave a flavor to crime when simple profligacy palled upon his
exhausted senses, and the honest citizens of Rome complained that
the female pilgrims who formerly crowded the holy fanes were
deterred from coming through fear of his promiscuous and unbridled
lust.<a id="FNanchor_325_325" href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></p>

<p>With such corruption at the head of the church, it is lamentably
ludicrous to see the popes inculcating lessons of purity, and urging
the maintenance of canons which they set the example of disregarding
so utterly. The clergy were now beginning to arrogate to themselves
the privilege of matrimony; and marriage, so powerful a
corrective of indiscriminate vice, was regarded with peculiar detestation
by the ecclesiastical authorities, and awoke a far more energetic
opposition than the more dangerous and corrupting forms of illicit
indulgence. The pastor who intrigued in secret with his penitents
and parishioners was scattering the seeds of death in place of the
bread of life, and was abusing his holy trust to destroy the souls
confided to his charge, but this worked no damage to the temporal
interests of the church at large. The priest who, in honest ignorance
of the canons, took to himself a wife, and endeavored faithfully to
perform the duties of his humble sphere, could scarcely avoid seeking
the comfort and worldly welfare of his offspring, and this exposed
the common property of all to dilapidation and embezzlement. Disinterested
virtue perhaps would not be long in making a selection
between the comparative evils, but disinterested virtue was not a
distinguishing characteristic of the age.</p>

<p>Yet a motive of even greater importance than this rendered
matrimony more objectionable than concubinage or licentiousness.
By the overruling tendency of the age, all possessions previously
held by laymen on precarious tenure were rapidly becoming hereditary.
As the royal power slipped from hands unable to retain it,
offices, dignities, and lands became the property of the holders, and
were transmitted from father to son. Had marriage been openly
permitted to ecclesiastics, their functions and benefices would undoubtedly
have followed the example. An hereditary caste would
have been established, who would have held their churches and lands
of right; independent of the central authority, all unity would have
been destroyed, and the collective power of the church would have
disappeared. Having nothing to gain from obedience, submission to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
control would have become the exception, and, laymen in all but
name, the ecclesiastics would have had no incentive to perform their
functions, except what little influence, under such circumstances,
might have been retained over the people by maintaining the sacred
character thus rendered a mockery.</p>

<p>In an age when everything was unsettled, yet with tendencies so
strongly marked, it thus became a matter of vital importance to the
church to prevent anything like hereditary occupation of benefices
or private appropriation of property, and against these abuses its
strongest efforts were directed. The struggle lasted for centuries,
and it is indeed most fortunate for our civilization that sacerdotalism
triumphed, even at the expense of what at the moment may appear
of greater importance. I cannot here pause to trace the progress of
the contest in its long and various vicissitudes. It will be found
constantly reappearing in the course of the following pages, and for
the present it will suffice to group together a few evidences to show
how rapidly the hereditary tendency developed itself in the period
under consideration.</p>

<p>The narrowness of the escape from ecclesiastical feudalization is
well illustrated by an incident at the council of Tours, in 925, where
two priests, <i>father and son</i>, Ranald and Raymond, appeared as complainants,
claiming certain tithes detained from them by another
priest. They gained the suit, and the tithes were confirmed to them
and their successors forever.<a id="FNanchor_326_326" href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> Even more suggestive is the complaint,
some thirty years later, of Ratherius, Bishop of Verona, who
objects strenuously to the ordination of the children sprung from
these illegal marriages, as each successive father made his son a
priest, thus perpetuating the scandal indefinitely throughout the
church; and as he sorrowfully admits that his clergy could not be
restrained from marriage, he begs them at least to bring their children
up as laymen.<a id="FNanchor_327_327" href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> This, however, by his own showing, would not remove
the material evil, for in another treatise he states that his
priests and deacons divided the church property between them, that
they might have lands and vineyards wherewith to provide marriage
portions for their sons and daughters.<a id="FNanchor_328_328" href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> This system of appropriation
also forms the subject of lamentation for Atto, Bishop of Vercelli,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
whose clergy insisted on publicly keeping concubines—as he stigmatizes
those who evidently were wives—to whom they left by will
everything that they could gather from the possessions of the church,
from the alms of the pious, or from any other source, to the ruin of
ecclesiastical property and to the deprivation of the poor.<a id="FNanchor_329_329" href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> How
well founded were these complaints is evident from a document of
the eleventh century concerning the churches of St. Stephen and
St. Donatus in Aretino. The priests in charge appropriated to
themselves all the possessions of the churches, including the revenues
of the altars, the oblations, and the confessional. These they
portioned out among each other and handed down from father to
son as regularly as any other property, selling and exchanging their
shares as the interest of the moment might suggest, and the successive
transmission of each fragment of property is detailed with all the
precision of a brief of title. The natural result was that for generations
the religious services of Aretino were utterly disregarded.
Sometimes the priestly owners would hire some one to ring the bells,
light the candles, and minister to the altar, but in the multitude of
ownerships the stipends were irregularly paid, and the officiator
refused continually to serve, candles were not furnished, bell-ropes
were not renewed, and even the leathers which attached the clappers
to the bells were neglected. The church of St. Stephen was the
cathedral of Aretino, yet the bishops were powerless to correct these
abuses. The marriages of their priests they do not seem to have
even attempted to repress, and were quite satisfied if they could
occasionally get a portion of the revenues devoted to the offices of
religion.<a id="FNanchor_330_330" href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> The same condition of affairs existed among the Anglo-Saxons.
“It is all the worse when they have it all, for they do not
dispose of it as they ought, but decorate their wives with what they
should the altars, and turn everything to their own worldly pomp ...
Let those who before this had the evil custom of decorating their
women as they should the altars, refrain from this evil custom, and
decorate their churches, as they best can; then would they command
for themselves both divine counsel and worldly worship. A priest’s
wife is nothing but a snare of the devil, and he who is ensnared
thereby on to his end, he will be seized fast by the devil.”<a id="FNanchor_331_331" href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

<p>It will be observed that, as the century advanced, sacerdotal marriage
became more and more common. Indeed, in 966, Ratherius
not only intimates that his clergy all were married, but declares that
if the canon prohibiting repeated marriages were put in force, only
boys would be left in the church, while even they would be ejected
under the rule which rendered ineligible the offspring of illicit unions;<a id="FNanchor_332_332" href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">332</a>
and, in spite of his earnest asceticism, he only ventures to prohibit
his clergy from conjugal intercourse during the periods likewise forbidden
to laymen, such as Advent, Christmas, Lent, etc.<a id="FNanchor_333_333" href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> It was
not that the ancient canons were forgotten,<a id="FNanchor_334_334" href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> nor that strenuous efforts
were not made to enforce them, but that the temper of the times
created a spirit of personal independence so complete that the power
of the ecclesiastical authorities seemed utterly inadequate to control
the growing license. About the year 938, Gerard, Archbishop of
Lorsch and Papal Legate for Southern Germany, laid before Leo
VII. a series of questions relating to various points in which the
ancient canons were set at naught throughout the region under his
supervision. Leo answered by a decretal addressed to all the princes
and potentates of Europe, in which he laments over Gerard’s statement
of the public marriages of priests, and replies to his inquiry as
to the capacity of their children for ecclesiastical promotion. The
first he pronounces forbidden by the canons, and those guilty of it
he orders to be deprived of their benefices. As for the offspring of
such marriages, however, he says that they are not involved in the
sins of their parents.<a id="FNanchor_335_335" href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></p>

<p>The unusual liberality of this latter declaration, however, was not
a precedent. The church always endeavored to prevent the ordination
of the children of ecclesiastics, and Leo, in permitting it, was
only yielding to a pressure which he could not withstand. It was a
most dangerous concession, for it led directly to the establishment of
the hereditary principle. An effort was soon after made, by an
appeal to the temporal power, to recover the ground lost, and about
the year 940 Otho the Great was induced to issue an edict prohibiting
the sons of deacons, priests, and bishops from occupying the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
positions of notary, judge, or count<a id="FNanchor_336_336" href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">336</a>—the bare necessity of which
shows how numerous and powerful the class had already become.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Although, as early as 925, the council of Spalatro seemed to find
nothing to condemn in a single marriage, but threatened excommunication
against those who so far forgot themselves as to contract a
second,<a id="FNanchor_337_337" href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> and though by the middle of the century the practice had
become generally established, yet some rigid prelates continued to
keep alive the memory of the ancient canons by fruitless protests
and ineffectual efforts at reform. In 948, the synod of Engelheim,
under the presidency of Marino, Bishop of Ostia and Papal Vicar,
condemned such marriages as incestuous and unlawful.<a id="FNanchor_338_338" href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> In 952, at
the council of Augsburg, the assembled German and Italian prelates
made a further and more desperate effort. Deposition was pronounced
against the subdeacon, deacon, priest, or bishop who should
take to himself a wife; separation of those already married was
ordered, and even the lower grades of the clergy, who had not previously
been subjected to any such rule, were commanded to observe
the strictest continence. An attempt was also made to prevent concubinage
by visiting suspected women with stripes and shaving; but
there evidently was some difficulty anticipated in enforcing this, for
the royal power is invoked to prevent secular interference with the
sentence.<a id="FNanchor_339_339" href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></p>

<p>This stringent legislation of course proved utterly nugatory, but,
futile as it was, it yet awakened considerable opposition. St. Ulric,
in whose episcopal town of Augsburg the council was held, addressed
a long epistle to the Pope, remonstrating against his efforts to enforce
the rule of celibacy, and arguing the question, temperately but
forcibly, on the grounds both of scriptural authority and of expediency.
He pointed out how much more obnoxious to Divine wrath were the
promiscuous and nameless crimes indulged in by those who were
foremost in advocating the reform, than the chaste and single mar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>riages
of the clergy; and the violent distortion of the sacred texts,
by those who sought authority to justify the canon, he not unhappily
characterized as straining the breast of Scripture until it yielded
blood in place of milk.<a id="FNanchor_340_340" href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></p>

<p>Despite the inefficiency of these attempts, the clergy were not
always allowed to enjoy their unlawful domestic ties in peace, and,
where the votaries of asceticism were bold and determined, the contest
was sometimes severe. The nature of the struggle is well illustrated
by the troubles which arose between Ratherius of Verona and
the ecclesiastics of his diocese. In April, 967, John XIII. held a
council at Ravenna which commanded those who were in holy orders
to give up at once either their wives or their ministry, and Otho the
Great was induced to issue a precept confirming this peremptory
decree. Ratherius had long been vainly wishing for some authority
on the subject more potent than the ancient and now obsolete canons,
and on his return from Ravenna he summoned a synod for the purpose
of promulgating the new regulations. His clergy got wind of
his intention; very few of them obeyed the summons, and most of
those who came boldly declared that they would neither be separated
from their wives nor abandon their functions; in fact, they did not
scruple to maintain that marriage was not only permissible, but even
necessary to protect the church from the most hideous vices. The
utmost concession he could obtain, indeed, came from a few who
endeavored to excuse themselves on the ground of poverty, which
did not enable them to live without the assistance of their wives, and
who professed to be willing to separate from them if they could be
assured of a regular stipend.<a id="FNanchor_341_341" href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> Ratherius had passed through too
many vicissitudes in his long and agitated career to shrink from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
collision, now that he was backed by both the papal and imperial
authority. He promptly threw the recalcitrant pastors into prison,
declaring that they should lie there until they paid a heavy fine for
the benefit of the cathedral of the Virgin, and he further commanded
the presence of those who had failed to appear. The clergy of the
diocese, finding that the resistance of inertia was unavailing, took
more decided steps, and appealed for protection to the temporal
power, in the person of Nanno, Count of Verona. He promptly
espoused their cause, and his <i>missus</i> Gilbert forbade their obedience
to the summons of their bishop for a year. Ratherius remonstrated
vehemently against the assumption of Nanno that the priests were
his vassals, subject to his jurisdiction, and entitled to protection, and
he lost no time in invoking the power of Otho, in a letter to Ambrose,
the Imperial Chancellor.<a id="FNanchor_342_342" href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> The clergy were too powerful;
the imperial court decided against the bishop, and before the end of
the year Ratherius was forced to retire from the unequal contest and
to take refuge in the peaceful abbey of Lobbes, whence he had been
withdrawn a quarter of a century before to fill the see of Verona.
Three times had he thus been driven from that city, and an intermediate
episcopate of Liége, with which one of his periods of exile
was gratified, had been terminated in the same abrupt manner by the
unruly clergy, unable to endure the severity of his virtue.<a id="FNanchor_343_343" href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> How
great was the revolution, to the unavailing repression of which he
sacrificed his life, is shown by his declaration, two years before, that
ecclesiastics differed from laymen only in shaving and the tonsure,
in some slight fashioning of their garments, and in the careless
performance of the church ritual. The progress of sacerdotal marriage
during the preceding quarter of a century is shown by a similar
comparison drawn by Ratherius some thirty years before, in which
matrimony is included among the few points of difference, along with
and the tonsure.<a id="FNanchor_344_344" href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>That the Veronese clergy were not alone in obtaining from the
secular potentates protection against these efforts on the part of
reforming bishops, is evident from the lamentations of Atto of Vercelli.
That estimable prelate deplores the blindness of those who,
when paternally warned to mend their evil ways, refuse submission,
and seek protection from the nobles. If we may believe him, however,
they gained but little by this course, for their criminal lives
placed them at the mercy of the secular officials, whose threats to
seize their wives and children could only be averted by continual
presents. Thus they not only plundered the property of their
churches, but forfeited the respect and esteem of their flocks; all
reverence for them was thereby destroyed, and, living in perpetual
dread of the punishment due to their excesses, in place of commanding
obedience, they were exposed to constant oppression and
petty tyranny.<a id="FNanchor_345_345" href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">345</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When prelates so sincere and so earnest as Ratherius and Atto
were able to accomplish so little, it is easy to understand what must
have been the condition of the dioceses intrusted to the great mass
of bishops, who were rather feudal nobles than Christian prelates.
St. Wolfgang of Ratisbon might issue thousands of exhortations to
his clergy, inculcating chastity as the one indispensable virtue, and
might laboriously reform his monasteries in which monks and nuns
led a life almost openly secular;<a id="FNanchor_346_346" href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> but he was well-nigh powerless for
good compared with the potentiality of evil conveyed by the example
of such a bishop as Segenfrid of Le Mans, who, during an episcopate
which lasted for thirty-three years, took to himself a wife named
Hildeberga, and who stripped the church for the benefit of his son
Alberic, the sole survivor of a numerous progeny by her whom he
caused to be reverenced as his <i>Episcopissa</i>;<a id="FNanchor_347_347" href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> or of Archembald,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
Archbishop of Sens, who, taking a fancy to the Abbey of St. Peter,
drove out the monks and established a harem of concubines in the
refectory, and installed his hounds and hawks in the cloister.<a id="FNanchor_348_348" href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">348</a>
Guarino of Modena might hope to stem the tide of license by
refusing preferment to all who would not agree to hold their benefices
on a sort of feudal tenure of chastity;<a id="FNanchor_349_349" href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> but he had much less
influence on his age than such a man as Alberic of Marsico, whose
story is related as a warning by Peter Damiani. He was married
(for, in the language of Damiani, “obscæna meretricula” may safely
be translated a wife), and had a son to whom he transferred his
bishopric, as though it had been an hereditary fief. Growing tired
of private life, however, he aspired to the abbacy of Monte Casino.
That humble foundation of St. Benedict had become a formidable
military power, of which its neighbors the Capuans stood in constant
dread. Alberic leagued with them, and a plot was laid by which
the reigning abbot’s eyes were to be plucked out and Alberic placed
in possession, for which service he agreed to pay a heavy sum, one-half
in advance, and the rest when the abbot’s eyes should be delivered
to him. The deed was accomplished, but while the envoys were
bearing to Alberic the bloody tokens of success, they were met by
tidings of his death, and on comparing notes they found that he had
expired at the very moment of the perpetration of the atrocious
crime.<a id="FNanchor_350_350" href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">350</a></p>

<p>So St. Abbo of Fleury might exhaust his eloquence in inculcating
the beauty and holiness of immaculate purity, and might pile authority
on authority to demonstrate the punishments which, in this
world and the next, attended on those who disobeyed the rule;<a id="FNanchor_351_351" href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> yet
when he endeavored, in the monastery of La Réole, a dependency
on his own great abbey of Fleury, to put his precepts into practice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
the recalcitrant monks flew to arms and murdered him in the most
brutal manner, not even sparing the faithful Adalard, who was
reverently supporting the head of his beloved and dying master.<a id="FNanchor_352_352" href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">352</a>
Damiani might well exclaim, when bewailing the unfortunate fate
of abbots, on whom was thrown the responsibility of the morals of
their communities—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Phinees si imitatur,</div>
  <div class="verse">Fugit vel expellitur;</div>
  <div class="verse">Si Eli, tunc irridetur</div>
  <div class="verse">Atque parvipenditur;</div>
  <div class="verse">Odiosus est, si fervens,</div>
  <div class="verse">Et vilis, si tepidus.<a id="FNanchor_353_353" href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>How little disposed were the ecclesiastical authorities in general to
sustain the efforts of puritans like St. Abbo was clearly shown in
the council of St. Denis, convened in 995 for the purpose of restoring
the neglected discipline of the church, when, passing over the object
of its assembling, the reverend fathers devoted their whole attention
to the more practically interesting question of tithes.<a id="FNanchor_354_354" href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">354</a></p>

<p>All prelates, however, were not either feudal chiefs or ascetic
puritans. Some, who were pious and virtuous, had so far become
infected with the prevailing laxity that they regarded the stricter
canons as obsolete, and offered no opposition to the domestic aspirations
of their clergy. Thus Constantine, Abbot of the great house
of St. Symphorian of Metz, in his life of Adalbero II., who was
Bishop of Metz from 984 to 1005, actually praises him for his liberality
in not refusing ordination to the sons of priests, and attributes
discreditable motives to those bishops who insisted on the observance
of the canons prohibiting all such promotions.<a id="FNanchor_355_355" href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> As Constantine was
a monk and a disciple of Adalbero, the tone which he adopts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
that the higher prelates and the regular clergy were beginning to
recognize sacerdotal marriage as a necessity of the age. This view
is strengthened by the fact that no effort to reform an abuse so universal
was made at the great synod of Dortmund, held in 1005 for
the special purpose of restoring the discipline of the church.<a id="FNanchor_356_356" href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">356</a></p>

<p>How completely, indeed, marriage came to be regarded as a matter
of course is manifest when, in 1019, an assembly of German bishops,
with the Emperor St. Henry at their head, gravely deliberated over
the knotty question whether, when a noble permitted his serf to enter
into holy orders, and the serf, presuming upon his new-born dignities
and the wealth of his benefices, married a free woman and endeavored
to withhold his children from the servitude which he still owed to his
master, such infraction of his master’s rights could be permitted out
of respect to his sacerdotal character. Long and vehement was the
argument among the learned prelates, until finally St. Henry decided
the point authoritatively by pronouncing in favor of the servitude of
the children.<a id="FNanchor_357_357" href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">357</a></p>

<p>But perhaps the most instructive illustration of the character and
temper of the age may be found in the three prelates who for more
than a century filled the rich and powerful archiepiscopal see of
Rouen. Hugh, whose episcopate lasted from 942 to 989, was nominated
at a period when William Longsword, Duke of Normandy,
was contemplating retirement from the world to shroud his almost
regal dignity under the cowl of the monk, yet what little is known
of his archbishop is that, though he was a monk in habit, he was an
habitual violator of the laws of God<a id="FNanchor_358_358" href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">358</a>—in short, we may presume, a
man well suited to the wild half-pagan times which witnessed the
assassination of Duke William and the minority of Richard the
Fearless. On his death, in 989, Duke Richard, whose piety was incontestably
proved by the liberality of his monastic foundations and
by his zeal for the purity of his monkish protégés,<a id="FNanchor_359_359" href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> filled the vacant
see with his son Robert, who held the position until 1037. Robert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
was publicly and openly married, and by his wife Herleva he had
three sons, Richard, Rodolf, and William, to whom he distributed his
vast possessions. Ordericus, the conscientious cenobite of the twelfth
century, looks, in truth, somewhat askance at this disregard of the
rules accepted in his own time,<a id="FNanchor_360_360" href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> yet no blame seems to have attached
to Robert in the estimation of his contemporaries. The family
chronicler characterizes him as “Robert bons clers, honestes hom,”
and assures us that he was highly esteemed as a wise and learned
prelate</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>His successor, Mauger, son of Duke Richard II., and archbishop
from 1037 to 1054, was worthy of his predecessors. Abandoned to
worldly and carnal pleasures, his <i>legitimate</i> son Michael was a distinguished
knight, and half a century later stood high in the favor of
Henry I. of England, in whose court he was personally known to
the historian.<a id="FNanchor_362_362" href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> The times were changing, however, and Mauger felt
the full effects of reformatory zeal, for he was deposed in 1054; the
see was bestowed on St. Maurilio, a Norman, who as abbot of Santa
Maria in Florence had been driven out and nearly poisoned to death
by his monks on account of the severity of his rule, and the Norman
clergy, as we shall see hereafter, experienced their share of suffering
in the mutation of discipline.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Notwithstanding this all-pervading laxity, the canons of the
church remained unaltered, and their full force was theoretically
admitted. Hopeless efforts, moreover, were occasionally made to re-establish
them, as in the council of Anse in 990, which reminded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
the clergy that intercourse with wives after ordination was punishable
with forfeiture of benefice and deprivation of priestly functions;<a id="FNanchor_363_363" href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">363</a>
and in that of Poitiers about the year 1000, which prohibited concubines
under pain of degradation.<a id="FNanchor_364_364" href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> In a similar spirit, a Penitential
of the period recapitulates the severe punishments of a former age,
involving degradation and fearfully long terms of penance.<a id="FNanchor_365_365" href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> All
this, however, was practically a dead letter. The person who best
represents the active intelligence of the age was Gerbert of Aurillac,
the most enlightened man of his time, who, after occupying the
archiepiscopal seats of Rheims and Ravenna, finally became pope
under the name of Silvester II. The lightness with which he treats
the subject of celibacy is therefore fairly a measure of the views
entertained by the ruling spirits of the church, beyond the narrow
bounds of cloistered asceticism. Gerbert, describing in a sermon the
requisites of the episcopal and sacerdotal offices, barely refers to the
“unius uxoris vir,” which he seems to regard in an allegorical rather
than in a literal sense; he scarcely alludes to chastity, while he
dilates with much energy on simony, which he truly characterizes as
the almost universal vice of his contemporaries.<a id="FNanchor_366_366" href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> So when, in 997,
he convened the council of Ravenna to regulate the discipline of his
church, he paid no attention whatever to incontinence, while strenuously
endeavoring to root out simony.<a id="FNanchor_367_367" href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> At an earlier period, while
Abbot of Bobbio, in an epistle to his patron, the Emperor Otho II.,
refuting various calumnies of his enemies, he alludes to a report of
his having a wife and children in terms which show how little importance
he attached to the accusation.<a id="FNanchor_368_368" href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">368</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

<p>Such, at the opening of the eleventh century, was the condition
of the church as regards ascetic celibacy. Though the ancient
canons were still theoretically in force, they were practically obsolete
everywhere. Legitimate marriage or promiscuous profligacy was
almost universal, in some places unconcealed, in others covered with
a thin veil of hypocrisy, according as the temper of the ruling
prelate might be indulgent or severe. So far, therefore, Latin
Christianity had gained but little in its struggle of six centuries
with human nature. Whether the next eight hundred years will
show a more favorable result remains for us to develop.</p>

<p>Before proceeding, however, to discuss the events of the succeeding
century, it will be well to cast a rapid glance at a portion of
Christendom, the isolation of which has thus far precluded it from
receiving attention.</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI">XI.</a><br />

SAXON ENGLAND.</h2>


<p>Whatever of virtue or purity may have distinguished the church
of Britain under Roman domination was speedily extinguished in
the confusion of the Saxon occupation. Gildas, who flourished in
the first half of the sixth century, describes the clergy of his time
as utterly corrupt.<a id="FNanchor_369_369" href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> He apparently would have been satisfied if the
bishops had followed the Apostolic precept and contented themselves
with being husbands of one wife; and he complains that instead of
bringing up their children in chastity, the latter were corrupted by
the evil example of their parents.<a id="FNanchor_370_370" href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> Under Saxon rule, Christianity
was probably well-nigh trampled out, except in the remoter mountain
districts, to be subsequently restored in its sacerdotal form under
the direct auspices of Rome.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the British Isles were the theatre of another and independent
religious movement. While the Saxons were subverting
Christianity in Britain, St. Patrick was successfully engaged in laying
the foundations of the Irish church.<a id="FNanchor_371_371" href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> We have seen (p. 76) that
celibacy was not one of the rules enforced in the infant Irish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
church; but this was of comparatively little moment, for that church
was almost exclusively monastic in its character, and preserved the
strictest views as to the observance of the vows by those who had
once taken them.<a id="FNanchor_372_372" href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> That the principles thus established were long
preserved is evident from a curious collection of Hibernian canons,
made in the eighth century, of which selections have been published
by d’Achery and Martène. Some of these are credited by the compilers
to Gildas, and thus show the discipline of the early British as
well as of the Irish church.<a id="FNanchor_373_373" href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> Their tendency is towards the purest
asceticism. A penance of forty days was even enjoined on the
ecclesiastic who, without thought of evil, indulged in the pleasure of
converse with a woman.<a id="FNanchor_374_374" href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> So in Ireland, a council held in 672
decrees that a priest guilty of unchastity, although removable according
to the strict rule of discipline, may be allowed, if truly contrite,
to retain his position on undergoing ten years of penitence<a id="FNanchor_375_375" href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">375</a>—an
alternative, one might think, rather of severity than of mercy.
One canon attributed to Gildas shows that in the British monastic
system unchastity was considered the most heinous of offences, and
also that it was sufficiently common;<a id="FNanchor_376_376" href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> while another alludes to the
same vice among prelates as justifying immediate excommunication.<a id="FNanchor_377_377" href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">377</a></p>

<p>The missionary career by which the Irish church repaid the debt
that it owed to Christianity is well known, and the form of faith
which it spread was almost exclusively monastic. Luanus, one of
the monks of Benchor, is said to have founded no less than a hundred
monasteries;<a id="FNanchor_378_378" href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> and when Columba established the Christian religion
in Scotland, he carried with him this tendency to asceticism and
inculcated it among his Pictish neophytes. His Rule enjoins the
most absolute purity of mind as well as body;<a id="FNanchor_379_379" href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> and that his teachings
were long obeyed is evident when we find that, a hundred and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
fifty years later, his disciples are praised for the chastity and zeal
of their self-denying lives by the Venerable Bede, who was fully
alive to the importance of the rule, and who would have wasted no
such admiration on them had they lived in open disregard of it.<a id="FNanchor_380_380" href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">380</a>
Equally convincing is the fact that Scotland and the Islands were
claimed to be under the supremacy of the see of York, and that
during the long controversy requisite to break down their schismatic
notions respecting the date of Easter and the shape of the tonsure,
not a word was said that can lead to the supposition that they held
any unorthodox views on the far more important subject of sacerdotal
purity.<a id="FNanchor_381_381" href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">381</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When, a hundred and fifty years after the Anglo-Saxon invasion,
Gregory the Great undertook the conversion of the islanders, the
missionaries whom he despatched under Augustin of course carried
with them the views and ideas which then held undisputed sway in
Rome. Apparently, however, asceticism found little favor at first
with the new converts, rendering it difficult for Augustin to obtain
sufficient co-laborers among his disciples, for he applied to Gregory
to learn whether he might allow those who could not restrain their
passions to marry and yet remain in the ministry. To this Gregory
replied evasively, stating, what Augustin already knew, that the
lower grades might marry, but making no reference whatever to the
higher orders.<a id="FNanchor_382_382" href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> He apparently did not wish to assume the responsibility
of relaxing the rule, while willing perhaps to connive at its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
suspension in order to encourage the infant Anglican church. If
so, the indulgence was but temporary.</p>

<p>The attempt has been made to prove that marriage was permitted
in the early Saxon church, and support for this supposition has been
sought from a clause in the Dooms of King Ina, of which the date
is about the year 700, fixing the wer-gild of the son of a bishop.
But the rubric of the law shows that it refers rather to a godson;<a id="FNanchor_383_383" href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">383</a>
and even if it were not so, we have already seen how often in France,
at the same period, the episcopal office was bestowed on eminent or
influential laymen, who were obliged on its acceptance to part with
their wives. The Magdeburg Centuriators, indeed, describe a council
held in London in 712 or 714, by which image-worship was introduced
and separation between priests and their wives was decreed,<a id="FNanchor_384_384" href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">384</a>
but there is no authority cited, nor is such an assembly elsewhere
alluded to, even Cave pronouncing it evidently supposititious.<a id="FNanchor_385_385" href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></p>

<p>These speculations are manifestly groundless. The celebrated
Theodore, who was Archbishop of Canterbury from 668 to 690, in his
<i>Liber Pœnitentialis</i>, forbids the marriage of the clergy under pain of
deposition, and all intercourse with such wives was punished by lifelong
penance as laymen; not only were digami ineligible to ordination,
but also even those who had kept concubines; and the zeal for purity
is carried so far that even baptism performed by priests guilty of fornication
was pronounced invalid and had to be repeated—an expression
of reprobation which it would be hard to parallel elsewhere in the
history of the church.<a id="FNanchor_386_386" href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> When such were the views of the primate, and
such were the laws which he prescribed, we cannot imagine that under
his vigorous rule these canons were permitted to be inoperative in a
church sufficiently enlightened to produce the learning and piety of
men like Bede and St. Aldhelm; where the admiration of virginity was
as great as that which finds utterance in the writings of these fathers,<a id="FNanchor_387_387" href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">387</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
and the principles of asceticism were so influential as to lead a powerful
monarch like Ina to retire with his queen, Ethelberga, from the
throne which he had gloriously filled, to the holy restrictions of a
monastic life.</p>

<p>Ecgberht, who was Archbishop of York from 732 to 766, is almost
equally decisive in his condemnation of priestly irregularities, though
he returned to the received doctrine of the church that baptism could
not be repeated.<a id="FNanchor_388_388" href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> It is also probable that even the Britons, who
derived their Christianity from the older and purer sources of the
primitive church, preserved the rule with equal reverence. At the
request of a national council, St. Aldhelm addressed an epistle to
the Welsh king, Geruntius, to induce him to reform his church so as
to bring it within the pale of Catholic unity. To accomplish this,
he argues at length upon the points of difference, discussing the
various errors of faith and discipline, such as the shape of the tonsure,
the date of Easter, &amp;c., but he is silent with regard to marriage
or concubinage.<a id="FNanchor_389_389" href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> Had the Welsh church been schismatic in this
respect, so ardent a celibatarian as Aldhelm would certainly not
have omitted all reference to a subject of so much interest to him.
The inference is therefore justifiable that no difference of this nature
existed.</p>

<p>We may fairly conclude that the discipline of the church in these
matters was reasonably well maintained by the Saxon clergy, with
the exception of the monasteries, the morals of which institutions
appear to have been deplorably and incurably loose. About the
middle of the seventh century John IV. reproves the laxity of the
Saxon monasticism under which the holy virgins did not hesitate to
marry.<a id="FNanchor_390_390" href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> In 734 we find Bede, in an epistle to Ecgberht of York,
advising him to create suffragan bishoprics and to endow them from
the monastic foundations, of which there were a countless number
totally neglectful of all monastic discipline, whose reformation could
apparently be accomplished in no other way.<a id="FNanchor_391_391" href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> St. Boniface, whose
zeal on the subject has already been sufficiently made manifest, about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
the year 746 paused in his reformation of the French priesthood to
urge upon Cuthbert, Archbishop of Canterbury, the necessity of
repressing the vices of the Saxon ecclesiastics. He dwells at considerable
length upon their various crimes and misdemeanors—drunkenness,
unclerical garments, neglect of their sacred functions, &amp;c.—but
he does not accuse them of unchastity, which he could not well
have avoided doing had there been colorable grounds for such a
charge. In fact, the only allusion connected with the question in
his epistle is a request that some restrictions should be laid upon the
permissions granted to women and nuns for pilgrimage to Rome, on
account of the attendant dangers to their virtue; in illustration of
which he states the lamentable fact that scarcely a city in Lombardy,
France, or the Rhinelands but had Saxon courtesans derived from
this source, to the shame and scandal of the whole church.<a id="FNanchor_392_392" href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">392</a></p>

<p>Pope Zachary seconded these representations, and in 747 Cuthbert,
yielding to the impulsion, held the celebrated council of Clovesho,
which adopted thirty canons on discipline, to remedy the disorders
enumerated by Boniface. Among these, the only ones directed
against unchastity relate solely to the nunneries, which were represented
as being in a condition of gross immorality.<a id="FNanchor_393_393" href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> The council
does not spare the vices of the secular clergy, and its silence with
respect to their purity fairly permits the inference that there was not
much to correct with regard to it, for had licentiousness been so prevalent
that Cuthbert had feared to denounce it, or had sacerdotal
marriage been passed over as lawful, the zeal of St. Boniface would
have led to an explosion, and Zachary would not have sanctioned the
proceedings by his approval.</p>

<p>The same argument is applicable to the council of Chelsea, held
in 787 by the legates of Adrian I., under the presidency of Gregory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
Bishop of Ostia. The vices and shortcomings of the Anglican
church were there sharply reproved, but no allusion was made to any
unchastity prevailing among the priesthood, with the exception, as
before, of nuns, on whom we may infer that previous reformatory
efforts had been wasted;<a id="FNanchor_394_394" href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> and in an epistle from Alcuin to Ethelred
King of Northumbria near the close of the century there is the same
reference to nuns, without special condemnation of the other classes
of the clergy.<a id="FNanchor_395_395" href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> That this reticence did not arise from any license
granted for marriage is conclusively shown by the interpolation of
the word <i>laicus</i> in the text I. Cor. <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span> 2, which is quoted among
the canons adopted.<a id="FNanchor_396_396" href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> To the same effect are the canons of the
council of Chelsea, in 816, in which the only allusion to such matters
is a provision to prevent the election of unfit persons to abbacies,
and to punish monks and nuns who secularize themselves.<a id="FNanchor_397_397" href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">397</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, it is true that about this time St. Swithun,
after obtaining orders, was openly married; but his biographer states
that he had a special dispensation from Leo III., and that he consented
to it because, on the death of his parents, he was the sole
representative of his family.<a id="FNanchor_398_398" href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> As Swithun was tutor to Ethelwulf,
son of King Ecgberht, the papal condescension is by no means impossible.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such was the condition of the Anglo-Saxon church at this period.
During the century which follows, the materials for tracing the
vicissitudes of the question before us are of the scantiest description.
The occasional councils which were held have left but meagre records
of their deliberations, with few or no references to the subject of
celibacy. It is probable, however, that a rapid deterioration in the
strictness of discipline occurred, for even the power of the great
Bretwalda Ecgberht was unequal to the task of repressing effectually
the first invasions of the Northmen, and under his feebler successors
they grew more and more destructive, until they culminated in the
anarchy which gave occasion to the romantic adventures of Alfred.</p>

<p>It is to this period of darkness that we must attribute the intro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>duction
of sacerdotal marriage, which became so firmly established
and was finally so much a matter of course that it attracted no
special attention, until the efforts made for its abrogation late in the
succeeding century. When Alfred undertook to restore order in his
recovered kingdom, the body of the laws which he compiled contains
no allusion to celibacy, except as regards the chastity of nuns. The
same may be said of the constitutions of Odo, Archbishop of Canterbury,
to which the date of 943 is attributed, although they contain
instructions as to the conduct of bishops, priests, and clerks<a id="FNanchor_399_399" href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">399</a>—whence
we may infer that the marriage even of consecrated virgins
was not uncommon, and that it was the only infraction of the rule
which aroused the opposition of the hierarchy. Simple immorality
called forth an occasional enactment, as in the laws of Edward and
Guthrun about the year 906, and in those of Edmund I. in 944,<a id="FNanchor_400_400" href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">400</a>
yet even to this but little attention seems to have been attracted,
until St. Dunstan undertook a reformation which was sorely needed.</p>

<p>St. Dunstan himself, although regularly bred to the church, with
the most brilliant prospects both from his distinguished abilities and
his powerful kindred, betrothed himself in marriage after receiving
the lower orders. His uncle, St. Elphege, Bishop of Winchester—apparently
a churchman of the stricter school—vehemently opposed
the union, but Dunstan was immovable in his determination. Elphege,
finding his worldly wisdom set at nought, appealed to the assistance
of heaven. His prayer was answered, and Dunstan was attacked
with a mysterious and loathsome malady, under which his iron resolution
gave way. He sought Elphege, took the monastic vow (the
only inseparable bar to matrimony), and was ordained a priest.<a id="FNanchor_401_401" href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">401</a>
This stern experience might have taught him charity for the weakness
of natures less unbending than his own, but his temperament was not
one to pause half-way. If, too, religious conviction urged him to
the task of restoring the forgotten discipline of the church, worldly
ambition might reasonably claim its share in his motives. He could
not but feel that his authority would be vastly enhanced by rendering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
the great ecclesiastical body dependent entirely upon him as the representative
of Rome, and by sundering the ties which divided the
allegiance due wholly to the church.</p>

<p>The opportunity to effect a reformation presented itself when the
young king, Edgar the Pacific, in 963 violated all the dictates of
honor and religion in his adventure with the nun at Wilton. Her
resistance attested her innocence, and the birth of a daughter did
not prevent her subsequent canonization as St. Wilfreda; but Edgar’s
crime and remorse were only the more heightened. When the terror-stricken
king sought pardon and absolution, Dunstan was prepared
with his conditions. Seven years of penitence, during which he was
to abstain from wearing the crown, was the personal infliction imposed
on him, but the most important portion of the sentence was that by
which the vices of the king were to be redeemed by the enforced
virtues of his subjects. He promised the founding of monasteries
and the reformation of the clergy; and his implicit obedience to the
demands of his ghostly judge is shown, perhaps, less in the fact that
his coronation did not take place until 973, than in the active measures
immediately set on foot with respect to the morals of the ecclesiastics.<a id="FNanchor_402_402" href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">402</a></p>

<p>That their morals, indeed, needed reformation is the unanimous
testimony of all the chroniclers of the period. Among all the
monasteries of England, formerly so noted for their zeal and prosperity,
only those of Glastonbury and Abingdon were inhabited by
monks.<a id="FNanchor_403_403" href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> The rest had fallen into ruin, or were occupied by the
secular clergy, with their wives, or worse, and were notorious as
places of the most scandalous dissipation and disorder.<a id="FNanchor_404_404" href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> So low was
the standard of morality that priests even scrupled not to put away
the wives of whom they grew tired, and to form new connections, of
open and public adultery;<a id="FNanchor_405_405" href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> and so common had this become that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
code of ecclesiastical law, probably drawn up about this time,
reproves this systematic bigamy, and appears to tacitly authorize
marriage as legitimate and honorable.<a id="FNanchor_406_406" href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> One author declares that
none but paupers could be found willing to bind themselves by
monastic vows;<a id="FNanchor_407_407" href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> and another asserts, with every show of reason, that
the clergy were not only not superior to the laity in any respect, but
were even far worse in the scandals of their daily life.<a id="FNanchor_408_408" href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">408</a></p>

<p>When King Edgar made his peace with the church by consenting
to the vicarious penitence of the priesthood, three rigid and austere
monks were the ardent ministers of the royal determination. Of St.
Dunstan, the primate of England, I have already spoken. St.
Ethelwold, his pupil, Abbot of Abingdon, was elevated to the see of
Winchester, and commenced the movement by expelling the occupants
of the monastery there. A few who consented to take monastic
vows were allowed to remain, and the remainder were replaced by
monks; but even St. Ethelwold’s rigor had to bend to the depravity
of the age, and he was forced to relax the rigidity of discipline in
non-essentials in order to obtain recruits of a better class.<a id="FNanchor_409_409" href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> The
difficulties he encountered are indicated by the legend which relates
that he was poisoned in his wine and carried from table to his couch
in excruciating torment, where he lay hopeless till, reproaching himself
with want of faith, he repeated the text—“Et si mortiferum
quid biberint, non eis nocebitur,” and was cured on the instant.<a id="FNanchor_410_410" href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">410</a>
That his canons were quite capable of such an attempt may be
assumed from the description given of them in the bull procured by
Dunstan from John XIII., authorizing their ejection by the king.
The pope does not hesitate to stigmatize them as vessels of the devil,
hateful to all good Christians on account of their inveterate and ineradicable
wickedness.<a id="FNanchor_411_411" href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">411</a></p>

<p>The third member of the reforming triumvirate was St. Oswald,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
Bishop of Worcester, who undertook a similar transformation of the
clergy occupying the monastery of St. Mary in his cathedral city.
Many promises they made to conform to his wishes, and many times
they eluded the performance, till, losing patience with the prolonged
procrastination, he one day entered the chapel with a quantity of
monkish habits as they were vigorously chanting “Servite Domino
in timore,” when he made practical application of the text by forcing
them to put on the garments and take the vows on the spot,
under the alternative of instant expulsion.<a id="FNanchor_412_412" href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">412</a></p>

<p>These proceedings met the unqualified approbation of Edgar, who
in 964, by his “Charter of Oswalde’s Law,” confirmed the ejection
of the recusants who refused to part with their wives, and transferred
all their rights and possessions to the newcomers. In the same
document he boasted that he had instituted forty-seven abbeys of
monks and nuns, and that he hoped to increase the number to fifty.<a id="FNanchor_413_413" href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">413</a>
The same year a similar summary process was carried out in the
convents of Chertsey and Winchester;<a id="FNanchor_414_414" href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> and in 966 Edgar was able
to boast of the numerous religious houses throughout England which
he had purified by replacing lascivious clerks with pious monks.<a id="FNanchor_415_415" href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">415</a></p>

<p>These efforts, however, tended only to restore the monastic foundations
to their original position, and left the secular clergy untouched,
except in so far as a few of them were deprived of the comfortable
quarters which they had usurped in the abbeys. This immunity it
was no part of Dunstan’s plan to permit, and accordingly Edgar
issued a series of laws restoring the obsolete ecclesiastical discipline
throughout his kingdom. By this code a lapse from virtue on the
part of a priest or monk was visited with the same penalty as homicide,
with a fast of ten years; for a deacon the period of penitence
was seven years; for the lower grades, six years. The monk, priest,
or deacon who maintained relations with his wife was subjected to
the same punishment; but there is no mention of degradation or
deprivation of benefice.<a id="FNanchor_416_416" href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">416</a></p>

<p>The struggle was long, and at one time the three reformers seem
to have grown wearied with the stubborn resistance which they met,
while the zeal of King Edgar grew more fiery as, with the true spirit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
of the huntsman, he followed up the prey, his ardor increasing as
the chase grew more difficult. In 969 he eloquently addressed
Dunstan, Ethelwold, and Oswald, blaming their lukewarmness in
the good cause, and promising them every support and assistance in
removing this opprobrium from the church.<a id="FNanchor_417_417" href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> Stimulated by these
reproaches, Dunstan summoned a council which adopted a canon
depriving unchaste priests of their benefices.<a id="FNanchor_418_418" href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> Still the conflict continued,
and a charter dated in 974, the last year of Edgar’s reign,
shows that he persevered to the end with unabated zeal.<a id="FNanchor_419_419" href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">419</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The contumacious clerks may have been silenced; they were not
subdued, and they but waited their opportunity. It came in 975,
with the early death of Edgar and with the dissensions caused by
his widow, Elfritha, who endeavored to deprive of the succession his
eldest son, the youthful Edward, fruit of a former marriage. During
the confusion, the ejected priests banded together and bribed Elfhere,
the powerful Ealdorman of Mercia, together with some other magnates,
to espouse their cause. In many abbeys the regulars were
expelled and the priests with their wives were reinstated. In East
Anglia, however, the nobles took sides with the monks, and, rising
in arms, valiantly defended the monasteries. At length, on the
accession of Edward, a council was assembled to make final disposition
of the question. The married priests were present, and promised
amendment; their noble protectors pleaded earnestly for them;
the boy-king was moved, and was about to pronounce in their favor,
when a miracle preserved the purity of the church. The council
was sitting in the refectory of the monastery of Hyde, the headquarters
of the ascetic party; Edward and Dunstan were enthroned
separately from the rest, with their backs to a wall on which, between
them, hung a small crucifix. At the critical moment, just as the
king was yielding, the crucifix spoke, in a low tone inaudible to all
save Edward and the primate, “Let not this thing be done”—the
mandate was imperative, and the married clergy lost their cause.<a id="FNanchor_420_420" href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">420</a></p>

<p>Still the stubborn priests and their patrons held out, and another
miracle was necessary—this time a more impressive one. A second
council was called to discuss the matter, and was held at Calne in
978. During the heat of the argument the floor gave way, carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
with it the whole assembly, except St. Dunstan, who remained triumphantly
and miraculously perched upon a joist, while his adversaries
lay groaning below, in every variety of mutilation.<a id="FNanchor_421_421" href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> His
triumph, however, was but short. The same year the pious child
Edward perished through the intrigues of Elfritha, whose son, Ethelred
the Unready, succeeded to the throne. The mixed political
and religious character of these events is shown by the canonization
of Edward, who, though yet a child, was regarded as a martyr by
the ascetics, whose cause he had espoused.</p>

<p>As Elfritha had evidently sought the alliance of the secular clergy
to strengthen her party, her success proved disastrous to the cause
of reform. The respite of peace, too, which had blessed the island
during the vigorous reigns of Athelstan the Magnificent and Edgar
the Pacific, gave place to the ravages invited by the feeble and vacillating
policy of Ethelred the Unready; the incursions of the pagan
Danes became more and more frequent and terrible; and what little
respect had been inculcated for the strictness of discipline was speedily
forgotten in the anarchy which ensued.</p>

<p>The efforts of the reformers appear to have extended even to the
British churches of Wales, which had followed Saxon example in
abandoning celibacy. The Brut y Tywysogion relates that about
the year 861 the priests were forbidden to marry without dispensation
from the pope; but they did not submit, and the disturbances
thus provoked rendered necessary the abandonment of the effort,
so that sacerdotal marriage continued unchecked.<a id="FNanchor_422_422" href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> We shall see
hereafter that in the Principality the custom remained in full vigor
until the thirteenth century was well advanced.</p>

<p>How thoroughly the work of Dunstan and Edgar was undone in
England is sufficiently indicated by the efforts made not long after,
with the consent of Ethelred, to introduce some feeble restraints upon
the prevailing immorality. About the year 1006 we find the chief
monastery of England, Christ Church at Canterbury, in full possession
of the secular clergy, whose irregularities were so flagrant that
even Ethelred was forced to expel them, and to fill their places with
monks.<a id="FNanchor_423_423" href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> What was the condition of discipline among the secular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
priests may be guessed from the reformatory efforts of St. Ælfric,
who was Archbishop of Canterbury from 995 to 1006. In his series
of canons the first eight are devoted to inculcating the necessity of
continence; after quoting the Nicene canon, he feels it to be so much
at variance with the habits and customs of the age, that he actually
deprecates the surprise of his clergy at hearing a rule so novel and
so oppugnant to the received practice, “as though there was no
danger in priests living as married men;” he anticipates the arguments
which they will bring against him, and refutes them with more
gravity than success.<a id="FNanchor_424_424" href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> There is also extant, under the name of St.
Ælfric, a pastoral epistle, which is regarded as supposititious by
some critics; but its passages on this subject are too similar in spirit
to the canons of Ælfric to be reasonably rejected. They show how
hopeless was the effort to maintain the purity desired by the ecclesiastical
authorities, and that entreaties and exhortations were uttered
merely from a sense of duty, and with hardly an expectation of commanding
attention. “This, to you, priests, will seem grievous, because
ye have your misdeeds in custom, so that it seems to yourselves
that ye have no sin in so living in female intercourse as laymen; and
say that Peter the Apostle had a wife and children.... Beloved,
we cannot now forcibly compel you to chastity, but we admonish
you, nevertheless, that ye observe chastity, so as Christ’s ministers
ought, in good reputation, to the pleasure of God.”<a id="FNanchor_425_425" href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">425</a></p>

<p>That these well-meant homilies effected little in reforming the
hearts of so obdurate a generation becomes manifest by the proceedings
of the council of Enham, held by King Ethelred in 1009. The
priests are there entreated, by the obedience which they owe to God,
to observe the chastity which they know to be due. Yet so great
was the laxity prevailing that some are stated to have two or more
wives, and many to be in the habit of changing their spouses at
pleasure, in violation of all Christian law. The council was apparently,
however, powerless to repress these scandals by an adequate
punishment, and contented itself with promising to those who lived
chastely the privileges and legal status of nobles, while the vicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
were vaguely threatened with the loss of the grace of God and
man.<a id="FNanchor_426_426" href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">426</a></p>

<p>The injunctions of the council as regards the regular clergy,
though not particularly specific in their nature, show that even the
monks had not responded to the benefits conferred upon them by
Edgar the Pacific, nor fulfilled the expectations of the pious Dunstan.
An expression employed, indeed, leads the learned Spelman to suggest
that there possibly were two orders of monks, the one married
and the other unmarried; but this is probably without foundation.<a id="FNanchor_427_427" href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">427</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such was the condition of the church when the increasing assaults
of the Northman finally culminated in overthrowing the house of
Cerdic, and placing the hated Dane upon the throne of England.
Cnut’s long and prosperous reign, and his earnest veneration for the
church, as shown by his pilgrimage to Rome, may perhaps have
succeeded in removing some of the grosser immoralities of the clergy,
but that marriage was still openly and unrestrainedly practised by
those in orders is evident. The ecclesiastical laws of Cnut exhort
priests to chastity in precisely the same words, and with the same
promises as the canons of the council of Enham, but do not allude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
to the habit of keeping a plurality of wives; while, in the same
chapter, a warning to the whole people against unlawful concubinage
would seem to indicate that clergy and laity were bound by rules
identical in strictness.<a id="FNanchor_428_428" href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">428</a></p>

<p>That the rule of celibacy was recognized as only binding on the
regulars, or monks, and that the secular priesthood were at full
liberty to marry is evident from the system of purgation enjoined on
them by the same code. The priest who was also a monk (sacerdos
regulariter vivens—sacerd þe regollice libbe), could clear himself from
an accusation in a simple suit by merely saying mass, and taking the
communion, while the secular priest (plebeius sacerdos—mæssepreorst
þe regol-lif næbbe) is only equal to the deacon-monk (diaconus
regularis—diacon þe regollice libbe), requiring two of his peers as
compurgators.<a id="FNanchor_429_429" href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> The significance of the distinction thus drawn is
rendered clear by the version of the passage in a curious Latin text
of the code published by Kolderup-Rosenvinge. The chapter is
divided into two, the first one with the rubric “De Sacerdotibus,”
and commencing “Si contigerit presbyterum regulariter et caste
viventem,” &amp;c., while the second is headed “De vulgare sacerdote
<i>non casto</i>,” the meaning of which is defined in the expression “Si
vulgaris presbyter qui non regulariter vivit.”<a id="FNanchor_430_430" href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> It is thus evident
that purity was expected from those only who had entered into the
obligations of monastic life, and also that the reforms of Dunstan
had caused the ministers of the altar to be frequently selected from
among the monks.</p>

<p>To this period are also, in all probability, to be attributed the
“Institutes of Polity, civil and ecclesiastical,” to which reference has
been made in the preceding section as blaming priests for decorating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
their wives with the ornaments belonging to their churches. Unable
to denounce efficient penalties for the prevention of such evil practices,
the author is obliged to content himself with invoking future
punishment from heaven, in vague and meaningless threats—“A
priest’s wife is nothing but a snare of the devil, and he who
is ensnared thereby on to his end, he will be seized fast by the
devil.”<a id="FNanchor_431_431" href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">431</a></p>

<p>From all this it is evident that the memory of the ancient canons
was not forgotten, and that their observance was still urged by some
ardent churchmen, but that the customs of the period had rendered
them virtually obsolete, and that no sufficient means existed of enforcing
obedience. If open scandals and shameless bigamy and
concubinage could be restrained, the ecclesiastical authorities were
evidently content. Celibacy could not be enjoined as a law, but
was rendered attractive by surrounding it with privileges and immunities
denied to him who yielded to the temptations of the flesh, and
who thus in some degree assimilated his sacred character to that of
the laity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Saxon church thus was practically regardless of the rule of
celibacy when Edward the Confessor ascended the throne. The
ascetic piety of that prince and his Norman education alike led him
to abhor the sensual indulgences in which he found his subjects
plunged, and he attached himself almost exclusively to the horde of
Norman monks who flocked to his court from across the Channel.
Their influence was all-powerful, and though reasons of the highest
state necessity forced him to ally himself in marriage with Edith,
daughter of the puissant Duke Godwin, whom Edward hated with
all the energy of his feeble nature, it was not difficult for his artful
ghostly counsellors to persuade him that a vow of virginity, taken
and kept amid the seductions of a throne, would insure his glory in
this world and his salvation in the next. A minstrel historian describes
at length the engagement of perpetual chastity entered into
between Edward and Edith at their marriage, and though he mentions
the popular derision to which this exposed the royal monk at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
hands of a gross and brutal generation, he is firmly persuaded that
the crown of martyrdom was worthily won and worn—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

  <div class="verse">Bein deit estre clamez martir.</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>How little the royal pair expected this example to be followed and
how relaxed were all the rules of monastic discipline is shown by an
anecdote of the period. The austere Gervinus, Abbot of St. Riquier
in Ponthieu was always welcomed by them when he visited England,
and on one occasion Queen Edith offered to kiss him. The Abbot’s
rigidity overcame his courtliness and he refused the royal salutation,
to the great indignation of the Queen, who ordered certain gifts
which she had set apart for him to be withdrawn. Edward, however,
approved of the action of the monk, and after Edith had been made
to understand his motives she not only joined in applauding him but
demanded that a similar rule should be made imperative on all the
monks of England.<a id="FNanchor_433_433" href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">433</a></p>

<p>It cannot be doubted that Edward made efforts to effect a reform
among his sensual and self-indulgent subjects, but his want of success
is developed in the description of the Saxon clergy at the time of the
Conquest. The Norman chroniclers speak of them as abandoned to
sloth, ignorance, and the lusts of the flesh; even monastic institutions
were matters rather of tradition than of actual existence, and
the monks themselves were hardly distinguishable by their mode of
life from the laity.<a id="FNanchor_434_434" href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> There doubtless may be some contemptuous exaggeration
in this, and yet one author of the period, who is wholly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
Saxon in his feelings, does not hesitate to attribute the ruin of the
Saxon monarchy and the devastation of the kingdom to the just
wrath of God, provoked by the vices of the clergy.<a id="FNanchor_435_435" href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">435</a></p>

<p>The rule of the Normans removed England from her isolation.
Brought into the commonwealth of Christendom and under the active
supremacy of the Holy See, her history henceforth becomes more
closely connected with the general ecclesiastical movement which
received its irresistible impulsion about this period. That movement
it is now our business to examine.</p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII">XII.</a><br />

PETER DAMIANI.</h2>


<p>In a previous section I have shown the laxity prevailing throughout
Continental Europe at the commencement of the eleventh century.
It is not to be supposed, however, that even where this was tacitly
permitted, it was openly and unreservedly authorized. The perversity
of a sinful generation might render impossible the enforcement
of the ancient canons; they might even be forgotten by the
worldly and unthinking; but they were still the law of the church,
and their authority was still admitted by some ardent devotees who
longed to restore the purity of earlier ages. Burckhardt, who was
Bishop of Worms from the year 1000 to 1025, in his voluminous
collection of canons, gives a fair selection from the councils and
decretals prohibiting all female intercourse to the clergy.<a id="FNanchor_436_436" href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> Benedict
VIII. and the Emperor St. Henry II.—whose admiration of virginity
was evinced by the personal sacrifice to which reference has
just been made—in 1022 endeavored in the most solemn manner to
reform the universal laxity. At the synod of Pavia a series of canons
was adopted pronouncing sentence of deposition upon all priests,
deacons, and subdeacons having wives or concubines, and upon all
bishops keeping women near them, while special stress was laid upon
the continued servitude of the children of all such ecclesiastics as
were serfs of the church.<a id="FNanchor_437_437" href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> These canons, signed by the pope and
attendant bishops, were laid before the emperor, who indorsed them
with his sanction, declared them to be municipal as well as ecclesiastical
law, promised that their observance should be enforced by the
civil magistrates, and thanked Benedict and his prelates for their
vigilance in seeking a remedy for the incontinence of the clergy, the
evils whereof swept like a storm over the face of Christendom.<a id="FNanchor_438_438" href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">438</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>In France, the long reign of Robert the Pious seems to have been
marked with almost entire indifference to the subject, but the accession
of his son Henry I. was attended with a strenuous effort to effect
a reform. The council of Bourges, held in November, 1031, but
four months after the death of Robert, may perhaps have been
assembled at the request of the dying monarch, desirous of redeeming
his own sins with the vicarious penance of his subjects. It
addressed itself vigorously to eradicating the evil by a comprehensive
series of measures, admirably adapted to the end in view. Priests,
deacons, and subdeacons were forbidden to have wives or concubines,
and all such consorts were ordered to be dismissed at once and forever.
Those who refused obedience were to be degraded to the rank of
lectors or chanters, and in future no ecclesiastic was to be permitted
to take either wife or concubine. A vow of chastity was commanded
as a necessary prerequisite to assuming the subdiaconate, and no
bishop was to ordain a candidate without exacting from him a promise
to take neither wife nor concubine. Children of the clergy in orders,
born during the ministry of their parents, were pronounced incapable
of entering the church, in justification of which was cited the provision
of the municipal law which incapacitated illegitimates from
receiving inheritance or bearing witness in court; but those who
were born after their fathers had been reduced to the condition of
laymen were not to be considered as the children of ecclesiastics.<a id="FNanchor_439_439" href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">439</a></p>

<p>Nothing could be more reasonable than all this, considered from
the high-church stand-point, and nothing better adapted to effect the
object in view. All that was wanting was the enforcement of the
legislation—and laws, when opposed to the spirit of the age, are not
apt to be enforced. How much was really gained by the united
efforts of the pope, the emperor, and the Gallican hierarchy can
readily be gathered from a few out of innumerable incidents afforded
by the history of the period.</p>

<p>The able and energetic, though unscrupulous, Benedict VIII. was
no more, and the great House of Tusculum, which ruled the Eternal
City, had filled the chair of St. Peter with a worthless scion of their
stock, as though to declare their contempt for the lofty pretensions
of the Apostolic Episcopate. A fit descendant of the infamous
Marozia and Alberic, Benedict IX., a child of ten years old at the
time of his elevation in 1032, grew up in unrestrained license, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
shocked even the dull sensibilities of a gross and barbarous age by
the scandals of his daily life.<a id="FNanchor_440_440" href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> The popular appreciation of his
character is shown by the legend of his appearing after death to a
holy man, in the figure of a bear, with the ears and tail of an ass,
and declaring that, as he had lived in bestiality, so he was destined
to wear the form of a beast and to suffer fiery torments until the
Day of Judgment, after which he was to be plunged, body and soul,
into the fathomless pit of hell.<a id="FNanchor_441_441" href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> When the Vicegerent of God, the
head of the Christian church, was thus utterly depraved, the prospect
of reforming the corruption of the clergy was not promising,
and the good work was not likely to be prosecuted with vigor.</p>

<p>Nor were the members of the hierarchy unworthy of their superior.
We hear of Rainbaldo, Bishop of Fiesole, who, not contented with
numerous concubines, had publicly married a wife, and whose children
were established as a wide-spread and powerful family—and,
what is perhaps more remarkable, this dissolute prelate was gifted
with the power of working miracles.<a id="FNanchor_442_442" href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> The bishops, indeed, at this
period, were still rather warrior nobles than Christian ministers.
Bisantio, the good Bishop of Bari, is praised quite as much for his
terrible prowess in battle as for his pious benevolence and munificence;
and on his death, in 1035, his flock chose a military official
as his successor.<a id="FNanchor_443_443" href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">443</a></p>

<p>Descending in the scale, we may instance the priest Marino, who,
though he lived openly with his wife, was a noted miracle-worker.
Among quaint wonders wrought by him it is recorded that water
rendered holy by his blessing, when sprinkled over the cornfields,
had the power of driving away all caterpillars and other noxious
insects. His child, Eleuchadio, was a most venerable man, who subsequently,
as abbot of the monastery of the Virgin at Fiano, won
the esteem and respect of even the stern Damiani himself.<a id="FNanchor_444_444" href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> In fact,
the pious Desiderius, Abbot of Monte Casino, better known as pope
under the name of Victor III., declares that throughout Italy, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
the pontificate of Benedict, all orders, from bishops down, without
shame or concealment, were publicly married and lived with their
wives as laymen, leaving their children fully provided for in their
wills; and what rendered the disgrace more poignant was the fact
that the scandal was greatest in Rome itself, whence the light of
religion and discipline had formerly illuminated the Christian world.<a id="FNanchor_445_445" href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">445</a>
Another contemporary writer asserts that this laxity prevailed
throughout the whole of Latin Christendom, sacerdotal marriage
being everywhere so common that it was no longer punished as
unlawful, and scarcely even reprehended.<a id="FNanchor_446_446" href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">446</a></p>

<p>In becoming thus universal and tacitly permitted it was not incompatible
with the most fervent piety; and though it may be an
evidence of hierarchical disorganization, it can no longer be considered
as indicating of itself a lowered standard of morals in the ministers
of the church. This is forcibly illustrated in the case of St. Procopius,
selected by Duke Ulric of Bohemia as the first abbot of the
monastery of Zagow. He was regularly bred to the church under
the care of Bishop Quirillus, and was noted for the rectitude of his
deportment in the priesthood; yet we learn that he was married
during this period, when we are told that, on being disgusted with
the hollow vanities of the world, he abandoned wife and friends for
the solitude of a hermit’s cave. Here an accidental meeting with
Duke Ulric, while hunting, led to the foundation of Zagow and to
the installation of Procopius as its head.<a id="FNanchor_447_447" href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">447</a></p>

<p>Silently the church seemed to acquiesce in the violation of her
canons, until, at length, she appeared content if her ministers would
satisfy themselves with reputable marriage and avoid the grosser
scandals. When Ulric, Abbot of Tegernsee, about 1041, deplored
the evil influence of a priest who had two wives living, he seems to
have felt that lawful marriage might be tolerated, but that polygamy
was of evil example in a Christian pastor.<a id="FNanchor_448_448" href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> So when Albert the
Magnificent, Archbishop of Hamburg, was accustomed to exhort his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
clergy to continence and to shun the pestiferous society of women,
his worldly wisdom prompted him to add that, if they were unequal
to the effort, they should at least keep unsullied the bonds of marriage
and should live “si non caste, tamen caute.”<a id="FNanchor_449_449" href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></p>

<p>If irregularities such as these existed, they are not justly imputable
to the church itself. It can scarcely be a matter of wonder if the
clergy, in assimilating themselves to the laity as regards the liberty
of wedlock, should also have adopted the license which in that lawless
age rendered the marriage-tie a slender protection for the weakness
of woman. Though it was indissoluble according to the teachings
of religion, yet the church, which at that time was the only protector
of the feeble against the strong, had not acquired the commanding
authority which subsequently enabled it to enforce its decrees everywhere
and on all occasions. If, under a vigorous pope, the sentence
of excommunication had been able to frighten a superstitious monarch
like Robert the Pious, yet the pontiffs of the House of Tusculum
were not men to trouble themselves, or to be successful had they
made the attempt, to rectify the wrongs perpetrated in every obscure
baronial castle or petty hamlet in Europe. The isolation and independence
of the feudal system made every freeman, so to speak, the
arbiter of his own actions. The wife whose charms ceased to gratify
the senses of her husband, or whose temper threatened to disturb his
equanimity, stood little chance of retaining her position, if an
opportunity offered of replacing her to advantage, unless she was
fortunate in having kindred able to resent the wrong which the church
and the law were powerless to prevent or to punish.<a id="FNanchor_450_450" href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> If, then, the
clergy occasionally indulged in similar practices, the evil is not
attributable to the license of marriage which they had usurped.
That license had, at all events, borne some fruits of good, for,
during its existence, we hear somewhat less of the system of concubinage
so prevalent before and after this period, and there is no
authentic indication of the nameless horrors so suggestively intimated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
by the restrictions on the residence of relatives enjoined in the frequent
canons promulgated at the close of the ninth century.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is not to be supposed, however, that the race of ascetics was
extinct. Amid the license which prevailed in every class, there were
still some men who, disgusted with the turbulent and dissolute world,
despairing of salvation among the temptations and trials of active
life or the sloth and luxury of the monastic establishments, sought
the path to heaven in solitude and maceration. Such men could not
but look with detestation on the worldly priests who divided their
thoughts between their sacred calling and the cares of an increasing
household, and who profaned the unutterable mysteries of the altar
with hearts and hands not kept pure from the lusts of the flesh.</p>

<p>Prominent among these holy anchorites was S. Giovanni Gualberto,
who fled from the snares of the world to the forests of Camaldoli,
where his austerities, his holiness, and his miracles soon attracted
crowds of disciples, who formed a numerous community of humble
imitators of his virtues. Restoring in its strictness the neglected
Rule of Benedict, his example and his teaching wrought conviction,
and the order of monks which he founded and carried with him to
the peaceful shades of Vallombrosa became renowned for its sanctity
and purity. Thus withdrawn by the will of heaven from the selfish
egotism of a hermit’s existence, he labored earnestly to reform the
laxity of priestly life in general, and his success was most encouraging.
Moved by his admonitions, self-indulgent clerks abandoned
wives and mistresses, devoted themselves to the performance of their
sacred functions, or sought in monastic seclusion to make atonement
for their past excesses.<a id="FNanchor_451_451" href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">451</a></p>

<p>Though it may well be supposed that Gualberto was not unassisted
in his efforts, yet all such individual exertions, dependent upon
persuasion alone, could be but limited in their influence and temporary
in their results. Reform, to be universal and permanent,
required to be authoritative in its character and to proceed from
above downward. The papacy itself must cease to be a scandal to
Christendom, and must be prepared to wield the awful force of
its authority, seconded by the moral weight of its example, before
disorders so firmly rooted could be attacked with any hope of success.
In 1044, Benedict IX. was driven out of Rome by a faction of
rebels or patriots, who elected Silvester III. as pontiff in his place.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
A sudden revolution sent Silvester into exile, and brought Benedict
back, who, to complete the confusion, sold the papal dignity to a new
aspirant, known as Gregory VI. The transaction was not one which
could decently be recognized by the church, and Benedict was held
incapable of thus transferring the allegiance of Christendom or of
depriving himself of his position. There were thus three popes,
whose conflicting claims to reverence threw all Europe into the doubt
and danger of schism, nor could the knotty question be solved by the
power of distracted Italy. A more potent judge was required, and
the decision was referred, as a matter of course, to the sagacious and
energetic Emperor, Henry the Black, whose success in repressing the
turbulence of the empire, and whose sincere reverence for the church
gave reasonable promise of a happy solution of the tangled problem.<a id="FNanchor_452_452" href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">452</a>
His proceeding was summary. The three competitors were unceremoniously
dismissed, and Henry filled the vacancy thus created by
the appointment of Suidger, Bishop of Bamberg, who assumed the
name of Clement II.</p>

<p>Henry III. was moved by a profound conviction that a thorough
and searching reform was vitally necessary to the church. The conscientious
severity of his character led him to have little toleration
for the abuses and disorders which were everywhere so painfully
apparent. How far his views were in advance of those generally
entertained, even by ecclesiastical dignitaries, was clearly manifested
as early as 1042, when Gebhardt, Bishop of Ratisbon, urged the
claims of his favorite arch-priest Cuno for the vacant see of Eichstedt.
Henry refused on the ground that Cuno was the son of a priest, and
therefore by the established canons ineligible to the position. The
reason, though unanswerable, was so novel that Gebhardt refused to
accept it as the true one, and Henry, to pacify him, promised to
nominate any other one of the Ratisbon clergy whom Gebhardt
might select. The choice fell upon a young and unknown man, also
named Gebhardt, whose abilities, brought into notice thus accidentally,
rendered him afterwards more conspicuous as Pope Victor II.<a id="FNanchor_453_453" href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">453</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

<p>Henry did not neglect the opportunity now afforded him of carrying
into effect his reformatory views, and in his selection of a pontiff
he was apparently influenced by the conviction that the Italian clergy
were too hopelessly corrupt for him to expect from them assistance
in his plans. Clement exchanged with him promises of mutual support
in the arduous undertaking. We have nothing to do with the
most crying evil; the one first vigorously attacked, and the one
which was productive of the greatest real detriment to the church—simony.
That was everywhere open and avowed. From the blessing
of the priest to the nomination for a primacy, every ecclesiastical
act was the subject of bargain and sale, reduced in many places to a
regular scale of prices.<a id="FNanchor_454_454" href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> To remove this scandal, Clement set
vigorously to work, and soon found an united opposition which
promised little for the success of the undertaking. He was doubtless
sincere, but he was clearly alone in his struggle with the fierce
Italian prelates, who were resolved not to abandon the emoluments
and indulgences to which they had grown accustomed, and the result
of his efforts did not fulfil the expectations of the more sanguine
aspirants for the purification of the church. Even his patron the
emperor appears to have doubted his earnestness in the cause, for we
find Henry not only addressing him a letter urging him to fresh exertion,
but intrusting it to Peter Damiani, with a command to present
it in person, and to use all his powers of exhortation to stimulate the
flagging zeal of the pope. Damiani refused to leave his hermitage
even at the imperial mandate, but he enclosed the missive in one of
his own, deploring the unhealed wounds of the church, recapitulating
the shortcomings of Clement, and goading him to fresh efforts, in a
style which savored little of the reverence due to the Vicegerent of
God.<a id="FNanchor_455_455" href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> The pontifical crown was evidently not a wreath of roses.
Clement sank under its weight, and died October 9th, 1047, in less
than ten months after he had accepted the perilous dignity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>St. Peter Damiani, who thus introduces himself to our notice, was
one of the remarkable men of the epoch. Born about the year 988 at
Ravenna, of a noble but decayed family, and the last of a numerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
progeny, he owed his life to a woman of the very class to the extirpation
of which he devoted all the energies of his prime. His mother,
worn out in the struggle with poverty, regarded his birth with aversion,
refused to suckle the infant saint, and neglected him until his
forlorn and emaciated condition awoke the compassion of a female
retainer, the wife of a priest, who remonstrated with the unfeeling
parent until she succeeded in arousing the sense of duty and restored
to existence the little sufferer, who was destined to bring unnumbered
woes to all who were of her condition.<a id="FNanchor_456_456" href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> His early years are said to
have been passed as a swineherd, till the opportunity for instruction
offered itself, which he eagerly embraced. Retiring at length from
the world, he joined the disciples of St. Romuald, who practised the
strictest monastic life, either as monks or hermits, at Avellana, near
Agubio. Immuring himself there in the desert, his austerities soon
gained for him the reputation of preëminent sanctity, and led to his
election as prior of the brotherhood. Gifted by nature with an intellect
of unusual strength, informed with all the learning of the day,
his stern asceticism, his dauntless spirit, and the uncompromising
force of his zeal brought him into notice and marked him as a fitting
instrument in the cause of reform. Occasionally, at the call of his
superiors, he left his beloved retreat to do battle with the hosts of
evil, returning with renewed zest to the charms of solitude, until, in
1057, Stephen IX. forced him to accept the cardinalate and bishopric
of Ostia—the highest dignity in the Roman court. The duties of
his episcopate, however, conflicted with his monastic fervor, and after
a few years he rendered up the pastoral ring and staff and again
returned to Avellana, where he died in 1072, full of years and
honors. His position and authority can best be estimated from
the terms employed by Alexander II., who, when sending him on
an important mission to France, described him as next in influence
to himself in the Roman church, and the chief support of the Holy
See.<a id="FNanchor_457_457" href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">457</a></p>

<p>With a nature ardent and combative, worked up to the highest
pitch of ascetic intolerance by the introspective musings of his cell,
it may readily be conceived that the corruptions of the church filled
him with warm indignation and fierce desire to restore it to its pristine
purity. To this holy cause he devoted the last half of his life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
and was always ready, with tongue and pen, at the sacrifice of his
dearly prized solitude, to further the great movement on which he
felt that the future of Christianity depended. The brief hopes excited
by the promises of Clement and Henry were speedily quenched
by the untimely death of the German pontiff, and the most sanguine
might well despair at seeing the odious Benedict IX. reinstated as
pope. But the emperor was in earnest, and listened willingly to the
cry of those who besought him not to leave his good work unfinished.
Nine brief months saw Benedict again a wanderer, and another
German prelate installed in his place. Poppo of Brixen, however,
enjoyed his new dignity, as Damasus II., but twenty-one days, when
he fell a martyr to the cause, perishing miserably, either through
the insalubrious heats of a Roman summer, or the hidden vindictiveness
of Italian party rage. It required some courage to accept the
honorable but fatal post, and six months elapsed ere a worthy candidate
could be found. Henry’s choice this time fell upon Bruno of
Toul, a prelate to whom admiring biographers ascribe every virtue
and every qualification. As Leo IX. he ascended the pontifical
throne in February, 1049, and he soon gave ample evidence of the
sincerity with which he intended to carry out the views of the puritans
whom he represented.</p>

<p>It was significant that he took with him to Rome the monk Hildebrand,
lately released from the service of his master Gregory VI.,
who had died in his German exile, restored by a miracle at his death
to the honors of which he had been adjudged unworthy while living.<a id="FNanchor_458_458" href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">458</a>
Still more significant was the fact that Leo entered Rome, not as
pope, but as a barefooted pilgrim, and that he required the empty
formality of an election within the city, as though the nomination of
the emperor had given him no claim to his high office. Whether this
was the result of a voice from heaven, as related by the papal historians,<a id="FNanchor_459_459" href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">459</a>
or whether it was done at the suggestion of the high-churchman
Hildebrand, it showed that the new pontiff magnified his office,
and felt that the line of distinction between the clerk and the layman
was to be sharply drawn and vigorously defended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

<p>Damiani lost no time in stimulating the stranger to the duties
expected of him by the party of reform. From the retreat of Avellana
he addressed to Leo an essay, which is the saddest of all the
sad monuments bequeathed to us by that age of desolation. With
cynical boldness he develops the frightful excesses epidemically prevalent
among the cloistered crowds of men, attributable to the unnatural
restraints imposed upon the passions of those unfitted by nature or
by training to control themselves; and his laborious efforts to demonstrate
the propriety of punishing the guilty by degradation show how
hideous was the laxity of morals which was disposed to regard such
crimes with indulgence.<a id="FNanchor_460_460" href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> Like the nameless horrors of the Penitentials,
it is the most convincing commentary on the system which
sought to enforce an impossible exaltation of purity on the ministers
of a religion whose outward formalism had absorbed its internal life.<a id="FNanchor_461_461" href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">461</a></p>

<p>Leo IX. was not long in manifesting his intentions, and his first
point of attack was chosen with some skill, the ecclesiastical rank of
the victim and his want of power rendering him at once a striking
example and an easy sacrifice. Dabralis, Archbishop of Salona (or
Spalatro) in Dalmatia, was married and lived openly with his wife.
Leo sent a legate to investigate and punish. Called before a synod,
Dabralis could not or deigned not to deny his guilt, but boldly justified
it, as the woman was his lawful wife, and he instanced the customs
of the Greek church in his defence. This only aggravated his
guilt, and he was promptly degraded forever.<a id="FNanchor_462_462" href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">462</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

<p>Leaving, for a time, the Italian church for subsequent efforts at
reformation, Leo undertook a progress throughout Northern Europe,
for the purpose of restoring the neglected discipline of those regions.
Before the year of his installation had expired, in November, 1049,
we find him presiding with the emperor at a council in Mainz, where
the simony and marriage of the clergy were condemned under severe
penalties.<a id="FNanchor_463_463" href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> That the influence thus brought to bear had some effect,
at least in externals, is shown by the courtly Albert of Hamburg,
who, on returning from the council to his see, revived a forgotten
regulation of his predecessors, by virtue of which the women of
ecclesiastics were ordered to live outside of the towns, in order to
avoid public scandal.<a id="FNanchor_464_464" href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">464</a> A few weeks before, in France, Leo had presided
over a national council at Rheims, where his vigorous action
against simony caused numerous vacancies in the hierarchy. The
records and canons of this council contain no allusions to the subject
of marriage or concubinage, but it is altogether improbable that they
escaped attention, for they were indulged in without concealment by
all classes of ecclesiastics, and some subsequent writers assert that
they were rigorously prohibited by the council, but that the injunctions
promulgated were unavailing.<a id="FNanchor_465_465" href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">465</a></p>

<p>Returning to the South, the Easter of 1051 beheld a council
assembled at Rome for the purpose of restoring discipline. Apparently,
the Italian prelates were disposed to exercise considerable
caution in furthering the wishes of their chief, for they abstained
from visiting their indignation on the guilty priests, and directed
their penalties against the unfortunate females. In the city itself
these were declared to be enslaved, and were bestowed on the cathedral
church of the Lateran, while all bishops throughout Christendom
were desired to apply the rule to their own dioceses, and to seize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
the offending women for the benefit of their churches.<a id="FNanchor_466_466" href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> The atrocity
of this legislation against the wives of priests is all the more noteworthy
when contrasted with the tenderness shown to worse crimes
committed by men whose high position only rendered their guilt the
more heinous. At this council, Gregory, Bishop of Vercelli, was
convicted of what, by the rules of the church, was considered as
incest—an amour with a widow betrothed to his uncle. For this
aggravated offence he was merely excommunicated, and when, soon
after, he presented himself in Rome, he was restored to communion
on his simple promise to perform adequate penance.<a id="FNanchor_467_467" href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">467</a></p>

<p>The reformatory zeal of Leo and of the monastic followers of
Damiani was thus evidently not seconded by the Italian church. A
still more striking proof of this was afforded by the attempt to hold
a council at Mantua early in 1053. The prelates who dreaded the
result conspired to break it up. A riot was provoked between their
retainers and the papal domestics; the latter, taken unawares and
speedily overpowered, fled to the council-chamber for safety, and Leo,
rushing to the door to protect them, was in imminent danger from
the arrows and stones which hurtled thickly around him.<a id="FNanchor_468_468" href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> The
reckless plot succeeded, and the council dispersed in undignified
haste. Whether Leo was disgusted with his want of success and
convinced of the impracticability of the undertaking, or whether his
attention was thenceforth absorbed by his unlucky military operations
against the rapidly augmenting Norman power in Southern Italy, it is
not easy now to ascertain: suffice it to say that no further indications
remain of any endeavor to carry out the reforms so eagerly commenced
in the first ardor of his pontificate. The consistent Damiani opposed
the warlike aspirations of the pontiff, but Leo persisted in leading
his armies himself. A lost battle threw Leo into the power of the
hated Normans, when, after nine months, he returned to Rome to
die, in April, 1054, and to be reverenced as a saint after death by
those who had withstood him during life in every possible manner.<a id="FNanchor_469_469" href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">469</a></p>

<p>It is not easy to repress a smile on seeing Leo, who had been so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
utterly unable to enforce the canons of the Latin church at home,
seriously undertaking to procure their adoption in Constantinople.
From his prison, in January, 1054, he sent Cardinal Humbert of
Silva Candida on a mission to convert the Greek church. There is
extant a controversy between the legate and Nicetas Pectoratus, a
learned Greek abbot, on the various points in dispute. I cannot
profess to decide which of the antagonists had the advantage on the
recondite questions of the use of unleavened bread, the Sabbath fasts,
the calculation of Easter, &amp;c., but the contrast between the urbanity
of the Greek and the coarse vituperation of the Latin is strikingly
suggestive as a tacit confession of defeat on the part of the latter. In
view of the frightful immorality of the Italian clergy, there is something
peculiarly ludicrous in the mingled anger, contempt, and
abhorrence with which Humbert alludes to the marriage of the Greek
clergy, which, as he declares, renders their church the synagogue of
Satan and the brothel of Balaam and Jezebel, with other equally
courteous and convincing arguments. Humbert attributes priestly
marriage altogether to the heresy of the Nicolites, and lays down the
law on the subject as inexorably as though it were at the time
observed in his own church.<a id="FNanchor_470_470" href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">470</a></p>

<p>After an interval of about a year, the line of German pontiffs was
continued in the person of Gebhardt, Bishop of Eichstedt (Victor
II.), whose appointment by the emperor was owing in no small degree
to the influence of Hildebrand—an influence which was daily making
itself more felt. Installed in the pontifical seat by Godfrey, Duke of
Tuscany, his efforts to continue the reformation commenced by his
predecessors aroused a stubborn resistance. There may be no foundation
for the legend of his being saved by a miracle from a sacramental
cup poisoned by a vengeful subdeacon, nor for the rumors that his
early death was hastened by the recalcitrant clergy who sought to
escape the severity of his discipline. There is some probability in
the stories, however, for, during his short pontificate, interrupted by
a lengthened stay in Germany and the perpetual vicissitudes of the
Neapolitan troubles, he yet found time to hold a synod at Florence,
where he degraded numerous prelates for simony and licentiousness;
but, whether true or false, the existence of the reports attests at once
the sincerity of his zeal and the difficulties of the task.<a id="FNanchor_471_471" href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">471</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

<p>His death in July, 1057, was followed after but a few days’ interval
by the election of Frederic, Duke of Lorraine—the empire having
passed in 1056 from the able hands of Henry III. to the feeble
regency of his empress, Agnes, as guardian of the unfortunate infant
Henry IV.—thus releasing the Roman clergy from the degrading
dictation of a Teutonic potentate. That Frederic should have abandoned
the temptations and ambitions of his lofty station to embrace
the austerities of monastic life in the abbey of Monte Casino, is a
sufficient voucher that he would not draw back from the work thus
far hopelessly undertaken by his predecessors. Notwithstanding the
severity of the canons promulgated during the previous decade, and
the incessant attempts to enforce them, Rome was still full of married
priests, and the battle had to be recommenced, as though nothing had
yet been done. Immediately on his installation, as Stephen IX., he
addressed himself unshrinkingly to the task. For four months,
during the most unhealthy season, he remained in Rome, calling
synod after synod, and laboring with both clergy and people to put
an end to such unholy unions,<a id="FNanchor_472_472" href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> and he summarily expelled from the
church all who had been guilty of incontinence since the prohibitions
issued in the time of Leo.<a id="FNanchor_473_473" href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> One case is related of a contumacious
priest whose sudden death gave him the opportunity of striking terror
into the hearts of the reckless, for the mutilated funeral rites which
deprived the hardened sinner of the consolation of a Christian burial
it was hoped would prove an effectual warning to his fellows.<a id="FNanchor_474_474" href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> Feeling
the necessity of support in these thankless labors, he forced
Damiani to leave the retirement of the cloistered shades of Avellana,
and to bear, as Bishop of Ostia, his share of the burden in the contest
which he had done so much to provoke—but it was all in vain.</p>

<p>In little more than half a year Stephen found refuge from strife
and turmoil in the tomb. The election of his successor, Gerard,
Bishop of Florence, was the formal proclamation that the church
was no longer subjected to the control of the secular authority.
January 18th, 1058, saw the power of the emperor defied, and the
gauntlet thrown for the quarrel which for three centuries was to
plunge Central and Southern Europe in turmoil and bloodshed.
Henry III. had labored conscientiously to rescue the papacy from
the disgrace into which it had fallen. By removing it from the petty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
sphere of the counts of Tusculum and the barons of the Campagna,
and by providing for it a series of highminded and energetic pontiffs,
he had restored its forfeited position, and indeed had conferred upon
it an amount of influence which it had never before possessed. His
thorough disinterestedness and his labors for its improvement had
disarmed all resistance to the exercise of his power, but when that
power passed into the hands of an infant but five years old, it was
natural that the church should seek to emancipate itself from subjection;
and if almost the first use made of its new-found prerogatives
was to crush the hand that had enabled it to obtain them, we must
not tax with ingratitude those who were undoubtedly penetrated with
the conviction that they were only vindicating the imprescriptible
rights of the church, and that to them was confided the future of
religion and civilization.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the revolution which thus may date its successful commencement
at this period the two foremost figures are Damiani and
Hildebrand. Damiani the monk, with no further object than the
abolition of simony and the enforcement of the austerities which he
deemed indispensable to the salvation of the individual and to the
purity of the church, looked not beyond the narrow circle of his
daily life, and sought merely to level mankind by the measure of his
own stature. Hildebrand, the far-seeing statesman, could make use
of Damiani and his tribe, perhaps equally fervent in his belief that
the asceticism of his fellow laborer was an acceptable offering to God,
but yet with ulterior views of transcendently greater importance.
In his grand scheme of a theocratic empire, it became an absolute
prerequisite that the church should hold undivided sway over its
members; that no human affection should render their allegiance
doubtful, but that their every thought and action should be devoted
to the common aggrandizement; that they should be separated from
the people by an impassable barrier, and should wield an influence
which could only be obtained by those who were recognized as
superior to the weaknesses of common humanity; that the immense
landed possessions of the church should remain untouched and constantly
increasing as the common property of all, and not be subjected
to the incessant dilapidations inseparable from uxorious or
paternal affections at a time when the restraints of law and of public
opinion could not be brought to bear with effect. In short, if the
church was to assume and maintain the position to which it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
entitled by the traditions of the canon law and of the False Decretals,
it must be a compact and mutually supporting body, earning by its
self-inflicted austerities the reverence to which it laid claim, and not
be diverted from its splendid goal by worldly allurements or carnal
indulgences and preoccupations. Such was the vision to the realization
of which Hildebrand devoted his commanding talents and
matchless force of will. The temporal success was at length all that
he could have anticipated. If the spiritual results were craft,
subtlety, arrogance, cruelty, and sensuality, hidden or cynical, it
merely proves that his confidence in the strength of human nature
to endure the intoxicating effects of irresponsible power was misplaced.
Meanwhile he labored with Damiani at the preliminary
measures of his enterprise, and together they bent their energies to
procure the enforcement of the neglected rules of discipline.</p>

<p>The new pope, Nicholas II. by name, entered unreservedly into
their views. Apparently taught by experience the fruitlessness of
additional legislation when the existing canons were amply sufficient,
but their execution impossible through the negligence or collusion of
the ecclesiastical authorities, he assembled, in 1059, a council of a
hundred and thirteen bishops, in which he adopted the novel and
hazardous expedient of appealing to the laity, and of rendering them
at once the judges and executioners of their pastors. A canon was
promulgated forbidding all Christians to be present at the mass of
any priest known to keep a concubine or female in his house.<a id="FNanchor_475_475" href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> This
probably remained, like its predecessors, a dead letter for the present,
but we shall see what confusion it excited when it was revived and
put effectually in force by Gregory VII. some fifteen years later.
Meanwhile I may observe that it trenched very nearly on the
Donatist heresy that the sacrament was polluted in polluted hands,
and it required the most careful word-splitting to prevent the faithful
from drawing a conclusion so natural.<a id="FNanchor_476_476" href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">476</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

<p>In addition to this, the council ordered, under pain of excommunication,
that no priest who openly took a concubine (or rather a wife),
or who did not forthwith separate himself from such a connection
already existing, should dare to perform any sacred function, or enjoy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
any portion of ecclesiastical revenue.<a id="FNanchor_477_477" href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> Hildebrand, who was all-powerful
at the papal court—his enemies accused him of keeping
Nicholas like an ass in the stable, feeding him to do his work—has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
the credit of procuring this legislation.<a id="FNanchor_478_478" href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> Nicholas, whether acting
under the impulsion of Hildebrand and Damiani, or from his own
convictions, followed up the reform with vigor. During the same
year he visited Southern Italy, and by his decided proceedings at the
council of Melfi endeavored to put an end to the sacerdotal marriages
which were openly practised everywhere throughout that region, and
the Bishop of Trani was deposed as an example and warning to
others.<a id="FNanchor_479_479" href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> Damiani was also intrusted with a mission to Milan for the
same purpose, of which more anon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

<p>Nor did Nicholas confine his efforts to Italy. His legates in
other countries endeavored to enforce the canons, and apparently had
little difficulty in obtaining the adoption of stringent regulations—the
more easily acceded to that they were utterly disregarded.
Thus his legate Stephen, early in 1060, held councils at Vienne and
Tours, where the prohibitions of the synod of Rome were agreed to,
and those who did not at once abandon either their women or their
benefices were declared to be degraded forever, without hope of restitution.<a id="FNanchor_480_480" href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">480</a></p>

<p>In practice, however, all these measures of reform were scarcely
felt except by the lower grades of the ecclesiastical body. The
prelates, whose lives were equally flagitious, and far more damaging
to the reputation and purity of the church, were enabled virtually to
escape. The storm passed beneath them, and with few exceptions
persecuted only those who were powerless to oppose anything but
passive resistance. The uncompromising zeal of Damiani was not
likely to let a temporizing lenity so misplaced and so fatal to the
success of the cause remain unrebuked; and he calls to it the attention
of Nicholas, stigmatizing the toleration of episcopal sins as an
absurdity no longer to be endured.<a id="FNanchor_481_481" href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> The occasion of this exhortation
was a commission intrusted by the pope to Damiani, to hold a
friendly conference with the prelates, and to induce them to reform
their evil ways without forcing the authorities to the scandal of public
proceedings. The fear of such results and the fiery eloquence of
Damiani were alike unheeded. The bishops confessed themselves
unequal to the task of preserving their chastity, and indifferent to
the remote contingency of punishment which had so often been ineffectually
threatened that its capacity for exciting apprehension had
become exhausted. With all the coarseness of monastic asceticism,
Damiani describes the extent of the evil, and its public and unblushing
exhibition; the families which grew and increased around the
prelates, the relationships which were ostentatiously acknowledged,
and the scandals perpetrated in the church of God. In the boldest
strain he then incites the pope to action, blames his misplaced clemency,
and urges the degradation of all offenders, irrespective of rank,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
pointing out the impossibility of reforming the priesthood if the
bishops are allowed full and undisturbed license.<a id="FNanchor_482_482" href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">482</a></p>

<p>This shows that even if the machinery of ecclesiastical authority
was at work to correct the errors of the plebeian clergy, it was only
local and sporadic in its efforts. In some favored dioceses, perhaps,
blessed with a puritan bishop, the decrees of the innumerable councils
may have been put in force, but in the great body of the church
the evil remained unaltered. During this very year, 1060, Nicholas
again found it necessary to promulgate a decretal ordering priests to
quit their wives or resign their position, and this in terms which
prove how utterly futile had been all previous fulminations. He also
manifested some consideration for temporal necessities by allowing
the discarded wives to live with their husbands under proper supervision.<a id="FNanchor_483_483" href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">483</a></p>

<p>How complete was the disregard of these commands is well illustrated
by an epistle which about this time Damiani addressed to the
chaplains of Godfrey the Bearded, Duke of Tuscany. From this we
learn that these prominent ecclesiastics openly defended sacerdotal
marriage, pronounced it canonical, and were ready to sustain their
position in controversy.<a id="FNanchor_484_484" href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> As Duke Godfrey, with the pious Beatrice
his wife, was the leading potentate in Italy, and as his territories
were in close proximity to Rome itself, it is evident that the reform
so laboriously prosecuted for the previous ten or fifteen years had
thus far accomplished little.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Parties were now beginning to define themselves. The reformers,
irritated by their want of success, were for more stringent measures,
and when the canonical punishments of degradation and excommunication
were derided and defied, they were ready, as we shall see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
hereafter at Milan, to have recourse to the secular arm, and to invoke
the aid of sword and lance. The clergy, finding that passive resistance
did not wear out the zeal of their persecutors, that the storm
promised to be endless, and warned by the fate of the Milanese, were
prepared to adopt an aggressive policy, and to seek their safety in
revolutionizing the central authority. Perhaps the bishops, whose
silence had been secured by the toleration so distasteful to Damiani,
began to feel the pressure which he was bringing to bear upon them,
and to look forward with apprehension to the unknown evils of
the future. If so, they were ready to make common cause with
their flocks, and throw into the scale the immense influence due to
their sacred character and temporal power. Thus only the occasion
was wanting for an open rupture, and that occasion was furnished
by the death of Nicholas in July, 1061.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The factions of the day had alienated a powerful portion of the
Roman barons from the papal party as represented by Hildebrand.
They at once united with the Lombard clergy in addressing a deputation
to the young Henry IV., who was still under the tutelage of
his mother Agnes, offering him a golden crown and the title of
Patrician. The empire was not indisposed to vindicate its old prerogatives,
recently annulled by the initial act of Nicholas limiting
the right of papal election to the Roman clergy. The overtures
were therefore welcomed, and while Anselmo, Bishop of Lucca, was
chosen in Rome, October 1st, 1061, assuming the name of Alexander
II., on the 28th of the same month a rival election took place in
Germany, by which Cadalus, Bishop of Parma, was invested with
the perilous dignity of Antipope, and divided the allegiance of
Christendom under the title of Honorius II. At least two Italian
bishops lent their suffrages to these proceedings—those of Vercelli
and Piacenza—as representatives of the Lombard interest; and, if
the testimony of Damiani is to be believed, they were men whose
dissolute lives fitly represented the license which the reformers
asserted to be the principal object of the schismatics.<a id="FNanchor_485_485" href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">485</a></p>

<p>The married or concubinary clergy were now no longer merely
isolated criminals, to be punished more or less severely for infractions
of discipline. They were a united body, who boldly proclaimed the
correctness of their course, and defended themselves by argument as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
well as by political intrigues and military operations. They thus
became offenders of a far deeper dye, for the principles of the church
led irrevocably to the conclusion, paradoxical as it may seem, that he
who was guilty of immorality, knowing it to be wrong, was far less
criminal than he who married, believing it to be right.<a id="FNanchor_486_486" href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">486</a> What before
had been a transgression, to be redeemed by penance and repentance,
became heresy—an awful word in those fierce times. The odious
name of Nicolites was speedily fastened on the schismatics, and the
Apocalyptic denunciations of St. John were universally held applicable
to them. According to Damiani, they supported Cadalus in
the expectation that his success would lead to a modification in the
discipline of the church, by which the license to marry would be
accorded to all ecclesiastics.<a id="FNanchor_487_487" href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">487</a></p>

<p>That support was efficient, and it was shortly needed. A revolution
suddenly occurred in the politics of Germany. Some dissatisfied
nobles and prelates conspired to obtain power by overthrowing the
regency of the dowager Empress Agnes. A stroke of daring
treachery put them in possession of the person of the boy-king, and
the arch-conspirator Hanno of Cologne earned his canonization by
reversing at once the policy of the previous administration. In a
solemn council held at Osber in 1062, the pretensions of Cadalus
were repudiated, and Alexander II. was recognized as pope. Still
Cadalus did not despair, but with the aid of the Lombard clergy he
raised forces and marched on Rome, relying on his adherents within
the walls. They admitted him into the Leonine city, where he threw
himself into the impregnable castle of San Angelo. Immediately
besieged by the Romans, he resolutely held out for two years, in spite
of incredible privations, but at length he sought safety in flight with
but a single follower. Meanwhile his party, as a political body, had
become broken up, and though Henry, Archbishop of Ravenna, still
adhered to him, he was powerless to maintain his claims. Finally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
in 1067, Alexander held a council at Mantua, cleared his election of
imputed irregularity, and was universally recognized.</p>

<p>During this period, the “Nicolitan” clergy by no means abandoned
their tenets. In 1063, as soon as he could feel reasonably
assured of his eventual success, Alexander assembled more than a
hundred bishops in council at Rome, where he emphatically repeated
the canon promulgated in 1059 by Nicholas II., which was not only
a proclamation of his fidelity to the cause of reform, but an admission
that the legislation of his predecessor had thus far proved fruitless.
Damiani, also, labored unceasingly with argument and exhortation,
but the vehemence of his declamation only shows how widely extended
and how powerful the heresy still was. We shall see hereafter that
on a mission to Milan, to reduce the married clergy to obedience, he
barely escaped with his life; and on another to Lodi, with the same
object, the schismatics, after exhausting argument, in support of
priestly marriage, threatened him with arms in their hands, and
again his saintly dignity came near being enhanced by the honors of
martyrdom.<a id="FNanchor_488_488" href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">488</a> Even the restriction upon second marriages was occasionally
lost sight of, and such most irregular unions were celebrated
with all the ceremony and rejoicings that were customary among
laymen in their public nuptials.<a id="FNanchor_489_489" href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> Yet, notwithstanding the pious
fervor which habitually stigmatized the wives as harlots and the
husbands as unbridled adulterers, Damiani himself allows us to see
that the marriage relation was preserved with thorough fidelity on
the part of the women, and was compatible with learning, decency,
and strict attention to religious duty by the men. Urging the
wives to quit their husbands, he finds it necessary to combat their
scruples at breaking what was to them a solemn engagement, fortified
with all legal provisions and religious rites, but which he pronounces
a frivolous and meaningless ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_490_490" href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">490</a> So, in deploring the habitual
practice of marriage among the Piedmontese clergy, he regards it as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
the only blot upon men who otherwise appeared to him as a chorus
of angels, and as shining lights in the church.<a id="FNanchor_491_491" href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">491</a></p>

<p>Such considerations as these, however, had no influence in diminishing
Damiani’s zeal. To Cunibert, Bishop of Turin, whose
spiritual flock he thus so much admired, he addressed, about 1065,
an epistle reproaching him with his criminal laxity in permitting
such transgressions in his diocese, and urging him strenuously to
undertake the reform which was so necessary to the purity of the
church.<a id="FNanchor_492_492" href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> Cunibert apparently did not respond to the exhortation,
for Damiani proceeded to appeal to the temporal sovereign of Savoy
and Piedmont, Adelaide, widow of Humbert-aux-Blanches-Mains,
who was then regent. In an elaborate epistle he urges her to attack
the wives, while her bishops shall coerce the husbands; but if the
latter neglect that duty, he invites her to interpose with the secular
power, and thus avert from her house and her country the Divine
wrath which must else overtake them.<a id="FNanchor_493_493" href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> That so strict a churchman
as Damiani should not only tolerate but advise the exercise of temporal
authority over ecclesiastics, and this, too, in a matter purely
ecclesiastical, shows how completely the one idea had become dominant
in his mind, since he was willing to sacrifice to it the privileges
and immunities for which the church had been struggling, by fair
means and foul, for six centuries. It would appear, moreover, that
this was not the first time that potentates had been allowed, or had
assumed, to exercise power in the matter, for Damiani cautions the
Countess Adelaide not to follow the example of some evil-minded
magnates and make the pretence of reformation an excuse for spoiling
the church.<a id="FNanchor_494_494" href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">494</a></p>

<p>The zeal of the indefatigable Damiani continued to be as unconquerable
as the stubbornness of his adversaries, and some two years
later we find him again at work. The date of 1067 is generally
attributed to a letter which he addressed to Peter, Cardinal Archpriest
of the Lateran, stimulating him to renewed exertions in extirpating
this foul disgrace to the church, and arguing at great length
in reply to the reasons and excuses with which the clerical Benedicks
continued to defend their vile heresy.<a id="FNanchor_495_495" href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">495</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>

<p>In all this controversy, it is instructive to observe how Damiani
shows himself to be the pure model of monkish asceticism, untainted
with any practical wisdom and unwarped by any earthly considerations.
When Hildebrand struggled for sacerdotal celibacy, the
shrewdness of the serpent guided the innocence of the dove, and he
fought for what he knew would prove a weapon of tremendous power
in securing for the church the theocracy which was his pure ideal of
human institutions. Not a thought of the worldly advantages
consequent upon the reform appears to have crossed the mind of
Damiani. To him it was simply a matter of conscience that the
ministers of Christ should be adorned with the austere purity through
which alone lay the path to salvation. Accordingly the arguments
which he employs in his endless disputations carefully avoid the
practical reasons which were the principal motive for enforcing celibacy.
His main reliance is on the assumption that, as Christ was
born of a virgin, so he should be served and the Eucharist be handled
only by virgins; and his subsidiary logic consists of mystical interpretations
of passages in the Jewish history of the Old Testament.
Phineas, of course, affords a favorite and oft-repeated argument and
illustration. Allusions to Ahimelech can also be understood, but
the reasoning based upon the tower of Sichem, the linen girdle of
Jeremiah, and the catastrophe of Cain and Abel is convincing only
as to the unworldliness of the recluse of Avellana.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all his learning and eloquence, the authority of
his name, the lustre of his example, and the tireless efforts of his
fiery energy, the cause to which he had devoted himself did not
advance. The later years of Alexander’s pontificate afford unmistakable
indications that the puritan party were becoming discouraged;
that they were disposed to abate some of their demands, and were
ready to make concessions to the refractory spirit which refused
obedience in both principle and practice. Thus, in 1068, a decretal
addressed to the authorities of Dalmatia merely threatens suspension
until satisfaction is made by those who marry in orders or who refuse
to abandon their wives.<a id="FNanchor_496_496" href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">496</a> A somewhat different position was taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
with the Venetians. An epistle to the Patriarch of Grado orders the
deprivation of those who live in open and undisguised concubinage,
but significantly confines its penalties to notorious infractions of the
rule, and leaves to God the investigation of such as may be prudently
concealed.<a id="FNanchor_497_497" href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> This manifests a willingness to temporize with offenders
whose respect for papal authority would induce them to abstain from
defiant disobedience—a pusillanimous tempting of hypocrisy to which
the bolder Hildebrand could never have given his consent. A principle
of great importance, moreover, was abandoned when, in 1070,
Alexander assented to the consecration of the bishop-elect of Le
Mans, who was the son of a priest;<a id="FNanchor_498_498" href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> and when he stated that this
was not a precedent for the future, but merely a concession to the
evil of the times, his laxity was the more impressive, since he thus
admitted his violation of the canons. He subsequently even enlarged
this special permission into a general rule, with merely the saving
clause that the proposed incumbent should be more worthy than his
competitors.<a id="FNanchor_499_499" href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">499</a> Alexander, moreover, maintained in force the ancient
rule that no married man could assume monastic vows unless his wife
gave her free consent, and entered a convent at the same time.<a id="FNanchor_500_500" href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">500</a> We
shall see that in little more than half a century the progress of sacerdotalism
rendered the sacrament of marriage powerless in comparison
with the vows of religion.</p>

<p>Alexander clearly had not in him the stuff of which persecutors
and reformers are made, as, indeed, his merciful liberality in extending
over the Jews throughout Europe the protection of the Holy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
See would sufficiently demonstrate. At length he, too, was released
from earthly cares, and on the day after his decease, on April 22,
1073, his place was filled by the man who of all others was the most
perfect impersonation of the aggressive churchmanship of the age.</p>

<p>Before proceeding, however, to sketch the stormy pontificate of
Hildebrand in its relation to our subject, I must pause to relate the
episode of the Milanese clergy. The struggle in that city to enforce
the ascetic principles of the reformers gives so perfect an inside view
of the reformation itself, and its various stages have been handed
down to us with so much minuteness by contemporary writers, that
it deserves to be treated by itself as a disconnected whole.</p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII">XIII.</a><br />

MILAN.</h2>


<p>In the primitive ages of the church, Milan was at the head of the
Northern Vicariate of Italy, as Rome was of the Southern. When
the preponderance of the latter city became established, the glory of
St. Ambrose shed a lustre over his capital which the true Milanese
fondly regarded as rivalling that of St. Peter and the superiority of
Rome was grudgingly admitted. In the eleventh century, Milan is
found occupying the chief place among the Lombard cities, virtually
governed by its archbishop, whose temporal as well as spiritual
power rendered his position one of great influence and importance.
Yet even at that early period, the republican spirit was already
developed, and the city was divided into factions, as the nobles and
citizens struggled for alternate supremacy.</p>

<p>Milan was moreover the headquarters of the hidden Manichæism
which, after surviving centuries of persecution in the East, was now
secretly invading Europe through Bulgaria, and had already attracted
the vigilant attention of the church in localities widely separated.
Its earliest open manifestation was in Toulouse, in 1018; at
Orleans, in 1023, King Robert the Pious caused numerous sectaries
to expiate their heresy at the stake, where their unshrinking zeal
excited general wonder. At Cambrai and Liége similar measures of
repression became necessary in 1025; the Emperor Henry III.
endeavored at Goslar, in 1052, to put an end to them with the
gallows; and traces of them are to be found at Agen about the year
1100; at Soissons in 1114; at Toulouse in 1118; at Cologne in
1146; at Périgord in 1147; in England in 1166, until we can trace
their connection with the Albigenses, whose misfortunes fill so black
a page in the history of the thirteenth century. Calling themselves
Cathari, and stigmatized by true believers under various opprobrious
names, of which the commonest was Paterins, their doctrines were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
those of the ancient Manichæans, their most characteristic tenets
being belief in the dualistic principle, and the abhorrence of animal
food and of marriage.<a id="FNanchor_501_501" href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">501</a> The prevalence of these dogmas among the
Milanese populace furnishes a probable explanation of much that
took place during the contest between Rome and the married priests.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Eriberto di Arzago, who filled the archiepiscopal chair of Milan
from 1019 to 1045, was one of the most powerful princes of Italy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
and though unsuccessful in the revolt which he organized in 1034
against the Emperor Conrad the Salic, his influence was scarcely
diminished after his return from the expulsion which punished his
rebellion.<a id="FNanchor_502_502" href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> At the time of his death, Milan was passing through one
of its accustomed civil dissensions. The Motta, or body of burgesses,
had quarrelled with the nobles and archbishop, and, under the leadership
of an apostate noble named Lanzo, had expelled them from the
city—an ejection which was followed by an unsuccessful siege of
three years. At length, in 1044, Lanzo obtained promise of armed
assistance from Henry III., which reduced the nobles to subjection,
and they returned in peace. Eriberto died the following year, and
the election of his successor caused great excitement. Erlembaldo,
the popular chief (dominus populi), called the citizens together to
nominate candidates, and induced them to select four. One of these
was Landolfo Cotta, a notary of the sacred palace, who was brother
to Erlembaldo; another was Anselmo di Badagio, Cardinal of the
Milanese church, subsequently Bishop of Lucca, and finally, as we
have seen, pope, under the name of Alexander II.; the third was
Arialdo, of the family of the capitanei of Carinate; and the fourth
was Otho, another Milanese cardinal. These four were sent to the
Emperor, for him to make his selection; but the faction of the nobles
despatched a rival in the person of Guido di Valate, who already
held the appointment of secretary from the emperor, and who had
recommended himself by zealous services, which now claimed their
reward. Henry gave the coveted dignity to Guido, to the great
surprise and indignation of the popular nominees. Their expostulations
were unavailing, and both parties returned—Guido to assume
an office harassed by the opposition of the people on whom he had
been forced, and the disappointed candidates to brood over the
wrongs which had deprived them of the splendid prize.<a id="FNanchor_503_503" href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">503</a> We shall
see how thoroughly three of those candidates avenged themselves.</p>

<p>It is observable from this transaction that Milan was completely
independent of Rome. The sovereignty of the distant emperor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
absorbed in the dissensions of Germany, could press but lightly on
the powerful and turbulent city. Rome was not even thought of in
creating the archbishop, whose spiritual and temporal power were
granted by the imperial investiture. But when, soon after, the
German popes had rescued the papacy from the contempt into which
it had fallen, its domination over Milan became a necessary step in
its progress to universal supremacy, and lent additional vigor to the
desires of the reformers to restore the forgotten discipline of the
church in a city so influential.</p>

<p>Marriage, at this time, was a universal privilege of the Milanese
clergy. If we may believe the testimony of one who was almost a
contemporary, the candidate for holy orders was strictly examined as
to his learning and morals. These being satisfactory, he was, if
unmarried, asked if he had strength to remain so, and if he replied
in the negative, he could forthwith betroth himself and marry with
the ordinary legal and religious ceremonies. Second marriages were
not allowed, and the Levitical law as to the virginity of the bride
was strictly observed. Those who remained single were objects of
suspicion, while those who performed their sacred functions duly,
and brought up their families in the fear of God, were respected
and obeyed by their flocks as pastors should be, and were eligible to
the episcopate. Concubinage was regarded as a heinous offence, and
those guilty of it were debarred from all promotion<a id="FNanchor_504_504" href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">504</a>—in this reversing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
the estimate placed upon the respective infractions of discipline by
the Roman church.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The see of Lucca consoled Anselmo di Badagio for the failure of
his aspirations towards the archiepiscopate, and the other disappointed
candidates for a while cherished their mortification in silence. Landolfo
and Arialdo were inclined to asceticism, and a visit which
Anselmo paid to Milan stimulated them to undertake a reform which
could not but prove a source of endless trouble to their successful
competitor Guido. Leaders of the people, and masters of the art of
inflaming popular passion, they caused assemblies to be held in which
they inveighed in the strongest terms against the irregularities of the
clergy, whose sacraments they stigmatized as the foulest corruption,
whose churches they denounced as dens of prostitution, and whose
property they assumed to be legitimate prey for the spoiler. Guido
in vain endeavored to repress the agitation thus produced, argued in
favor of the married clergy, and was sustained by the party of the
nobles. In a city like Milan, it was not difficult to excite a tumult.
Besides the influence of the perennial factions, ever eager to tear
each other’s throats, the populace were ready to yield to the eloquence
of the bold reformers. The Manichæan heresy had taken deep root
among the masses, who, afraid to declare their damnable doctrines
openly, were rejoiced in any way to undermine the authority of the
priesthood, and whose views were in accordance with those now
broached on the subject of marriage.<a id="FNanchor_505_505" href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">505</a> While these motives would
urge forward the serious portion of the citizens, the unthinking
rabble would naturally be prompt to embrace any cause which
promised a prospect of disturbance and plunder. Party lines were
quickly drawn, and if the reformers were able to revive a forgotten
scandal by stigmatizing their opponents as Nicolites, the party of the
clergy and the nobles had their revenge. The meetings of Landolfo
and Arialdo were held in a spot called Pataria, whence they soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
became known as Paterins—a term which for centuries continued to
be of fearful import, as synonymous with Manichæans.<a id="FNanchor_506_506" href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">506</a></p>

<p>Matters could not long remain in this condition. During an
altercation in the church of San Celso, a hot-headed priest assaulted
Arialdo, whom Landolfo extricated from the crowd at considerable
personal risk. Thereupon the reformers called the people together
in the theatre; inflammatory addresses speedily wrought up the
popular passions to ungovernable fury; the priests were turned out
of the churches, their houses sacked, their persons maltreated, and
they were finally obliged to purchase a suspension of oppression by
subscribing a paper binding themselves to chastity. The nobles, far
from being able to protect the clergy, finding themselves also in
danger, sought safety in flight; while the rabble, having exhausted
the support derivable from intramural plunder, spread over the
country and repeated in the villages the devastations of priestly
property which they had committed in Milan.<a id="FNanchor_507_507" href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">507</a></p>

<p>The suffering clergy applied for relief to the bishops of the
province, and finding none, at length appealed to Rome itself.
Stephen IX., who then filled the papal chair, authorized the archbishop
to hold a synod for the purpose of restoring peace. It met,
in the early part of 1058, at Fontaneto, near Novara. The prelates
were unanimous in sustaining their clergy, and the reformers
Landolfo and Arialdo were excommunicated without a dissentient
voice. They disregarded the interdict, however, redoubled their
efforts with the people, whom they bound by a solemn oath to
adhere to the sacred cause, and even forced the priests to join in the
compact. Arialdo then proceeded to Rome, where he developed in
full the objects of the movement, and pointed out that it would not
only result in restoring purity and discipline, but might also be used
to break down the dangerous independence of the Ambrosian church
and reduce it to the subjection which it owed and refused to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
Apostolic see. The arguments were convincing, the excommunication
was removed, and Arialdo returned to his work with zeal more
fiery than ever.<a id="FNanchor_508_508" href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">508</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the nobles had taken heart and offered armed resistance
to the Patarian faction, resulting in incessant fights and increasing
bloodshed. Nicholas II., who by this time had succeeded Stephen
IX., sent Hildebrand and Anselmo di Badagio on a mission to
Milan, with instructions to allay the passions which led to such
deplorable results, and, while endeavoring to uphold the rules of
discipline, to pacify if possible the people, and to arrange such a basis
of reconciliation as might restore peace to the distracted church.
The milder Anselmo might perhaps have succeeded in this errand of
charity, but the unbending Hildebrand was not likely to listen to
aught but unconditional subjection to the canons and to Rome. The
quarrel therefore waxed fiercer and deadlier; the turmoil became
more inextricable as daily combats embittered both parties, and the
missionaries departed, leaving Guido with scarcely a shadow of
authority over his rebellious city, and the seeds of discord more
widely scattered and more deeply planted than ever.<a id="FNanchor_509_509" href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">509</a></p>

<p>Again, in 1059, a papal legation was sent with full authority
to force the recalcitrant clergy to submission. Anselmo again
returned to his native city, accompanied this time by Peter Damiani.
Their presence and their pretensions caused a fearful tumult, in which
Damiani and Landolfo were in deadly peril.<a id="FNanchor_510_510" href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">510</a> An assembly was at
length held, where the legates asserted the papal preëminence by
taking the place of honor, to the general indignation of the Milanese,
who did not relish the degradation of their archbishop before the
representatives of a foreign prelate. The question in debate hinged
upon the authority of Rome, which was stoutly denied by the
Lombards.<a id="FNanchor_511_511" href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> Peter, in a long oration, showed that Rome had christianized
the rest of Western Europe, and that St. Ambrose himself had
invoked the papal power as superior to his own. The pride of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
Ambrosian church gave way, and the supremacy of St. Peter was
finally acknowledged. This granted, the rest followed as a matter of
course, and the heretical errors of simony and marriage had to be
abandoned. Peter thought himself merciful in his triumph; where
all alike were guilty, punishment for the past became impossible, and
he restricted himself to provisions for the future. The archbishop
and his clergy signed a paper expressing their contrition in the most
humiliating terms, and binding themselves and their successors, under
penalty of eternal damnation, to render simony thereafter unknown.
As regards the Nicolitan heresy, a significant caution was observed,
for its extirpation was only promised in as far as it should be found
possible;<a id="FNanchor_512_512" href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> and when Arnolfo, the nephew of Guido, swore for his
uncle that in future monks should be the only persons ordained
without a preliminary oath that no money had been paid or received,
it is observable that the maintenance of chastity was discreetly
passed over. Then the archbishop and his clergy swore, in the
hands of Damiani at the altar, their faithful observance of the pledge
to destroy the simoniacal and Nicolitan heresies, under penalties the
most tremendous; and Guido prostrating himself on the ground,
humbly deplored his negligence in the past, imposed on himself a
penitence of a hundred years (redeemable at a certain sum per
annum), and vowed a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostella to atone
for his sin. Not content with this, Damiani mounted the pulpit and
made both priests and people take an oath to extirpate both heresies;
and the clergy, before being reconciled to the church and restored to
the positions which they had forfeited by their contumacy, were
forced individually under oath to anathematize all heresies, and
especially those of simony and marriage. A penance was imposed
on every one involved in simony—no allusion being made to those
who were married; some, who were manifestly unfit for their sacred
duties, were suspended, and the legates returned, after triumphantly
accomplishing the objects of their mission.<a id="FNanchor_513_513" href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">513</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

<p>If Damiani fancied that argumentative subtlety and paper promises,
even though solemnly given in the name of God and all his saints,
were to settle a question involving the fiercest passions of men, the
cloistered saint knew little of human nature. The pride of the
Milanese was deeply wounded by a subjection to Rome, unknown for
many generations, and ill endured by men who gloried in the ancient
dignity of the Ambrosian church. When, therefore, in 1061, their
townsman, Anselmo di Badagio, was elevated from the episcopate of
Lucca to that of the Holy See, Milan, in common with the rest
of Lombardy, eagerly embraced the cause of the anti-pope Cadalus.
One of Anselmo’s earliest acts as pope was to address a letter to the
Milanese, affectionately exhorting them to amendment, and expressing
a hope that his pontificate was to witness the extinction of the
heresies which had distracted and degraded the church.<a id="FNanchor_514_514" href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">514</a> He could
scarcely have entertained the confidence which he expressed, for
though Landolfo and Arialdo endeavored, with unabated zeal, to
enforce the canons, the Nicolitan faction, regardless of the pledges
given to Damiani, maintained the contest with equal stubbornness.
Landolfo, on a mission to Rome, was attacked at Piacenza, wounded,
and forced to return. Soon after this he was prostrated by a pulmonary
affection, lost his voice, and died after a lingering illness of two
years.<a id="FNanchor_515_515" href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> The Paterins, thus deprived of their leader, found another
in the person of his brother, Erlembaldo, just then returned from a
pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Gifted with every knightly accomplishment,
valiant in war, sagacious in council, of a commanding
presence, and endowed with eloquence to sway the passions of the
multitude, he was the impersonation of a popular leader; while, in
the cause to which he was now called, his deep religious convictions
lent an attraction which was heightened by an unpardonable personal
wrong—for, early in life, he had been betrothed to a young girl, who
fell under the seductive wiles of an unprincipled priest. Yet
Erlembaldo did not embark in civil strife without a hesitation which
reflects honor on his character. He refused, at first, but was
persuaded to seek counsel of the pope. Arialdo accompanied him to
Rome, and urged Alexander to adopt him as military leader in the
war against sacerdotal marriage. Alexander, too, shrank from
the responsibility of authorizing war in such a cause, but Arialdo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
sought the assistance of Hildebrand, and the scruples of the pope
were removed by the prospect of asserting the authority of Rome.
When Erlembaldo heard the commands of the Vicegerent of God,
and received a sacred banner to be borne through the expected
battles, he could no longer doubt as to his duty. He accepted the
mission, and to it he devoted his life.<a id="FNanchor_516_516" href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">516</a></p>

<p>Returning to Milan with this sanction, the zeal and military
experience of Erlembaldo soon made themselves felt. He enrolled
secretly all the young men whom persuasion, threats, or promises
could induce to follow his standard, and thus supported by an organized
body, he endeavored to enforce the decretals inhibiting simony
and marriage. All recalcitrant priests presuming to officiate were
torn from the altars. The riots, which seem to have ceased for a
time, became, with varying fortune, more numerous and alarming
than ever, and the persecution of the clergy was greatly intensified.
Guido, at length, after vainly endeavoring to uphold and protect the
sacerdotal body, was driven from the city, and the popular reformers
seemed at last to have carried their point, after a civil war which
had now lasted, with short intervals, for nearly ten years.<a id="FNanchor_517_517" href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">517</a></p>

<p>As though to confirm the victory, Arialdo, in 1066, at a council
held in Rome, procured the excommunication of his archbishop,
Guido, with which he returned triumphantly to Milan. Some
popular revolution among the factions, however, had brought Guido
back to the city, where he maintained a precarious position. Disregarding
the excommunication, he resolved to officiate in the solemn
services of Pentecost (June 4th, 1066), and, braving all opposition,
he appeared at the altar. Excited to fury at this unexpected contumacy,
the popular party, led on by Erlembaldo and Arialdo,
attacked him in the church; his followers rallied in his defence, but,
after a stubborn fight, were forced to leave him in the hands of his
enemies, by whom he was beaten nearly to death. Shocked by this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
outrage, many of the citizens abandoned the party of the reformers,
and the nobles, taking advantage of the revulsion of feeling, again
had the ascendency. Arialdo was obliged to fly for his life, and
endeavored to conceal himself, travelling only by night. The
avengers were close upon his track, however; he was betrayed by a
priest, and the satellites of Guido carried him to an island in Lago
Maggiore, where (June 27th, 1066) they put him to death, with all
the refinement of cruelty. A series of miracles prevented the
attempted concealment of the martyred corpse, and ten months later
Erlembaldo recovered it, fresh and untouched by corruption. Carried
to Milan, it was interred with stately pomp in the monastery of San
Celso, where the miracles wrought at his tomb proclaimed the sanctity
of him who had died for the faith, and ere long his canonization
formally enrolled St. Arialdo among the saints of Heaven.<a id="FNanchor_518_518" href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">518</a></p>

<p>Erlembaldo for a while remained quiet, but in secret he reconstructed
his party, and, undaunted by the fate of his associate, he
suddenly renewed the civil strife. Successful at first, he forced the
clergy to bind themselves by fresh oaths, and expelled Guido again
from the city; but the clerical party recovered its strength, and the
war was carried on with varying fortune, until, in 1067, Alexander
II. despatched another legation with orders to harmonize, if possible,
the endless strife. Cardinals Mainardo and Minuto appear to have
been sincerely desirous of reconciling the angry factions. They proclaimed
an amnesty and promulgated a constitution which protected
the clergy from abuse and persecution, and though they decreed suspension
for married and concubinary priests, they required that none
should be punished on suspicion, and laid down such regulations for
trial as gave great prospect of immunity.<a id="FNanchor_519_519" href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">519</a> There must have been
pressing necessity for some such regulations, if we may believe the
assertion of Landolfo that when Erlembaldo found his funds running
low he appointed thirty judges to examine all ecclesiastics in holy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
orders. Those who could not procure twelve conjurators to swear
with them on the Gospels as to their immaculate purity since ordination,
had all their property confiscated. At the same time the
rabble used to prowl around at night and throw female ornaments
and articles of apparel into priests’ houses; then, breaking open the
doors, they would proclaim the criminality of the inmates, and
plunder everything that they could lay their hands on.<a id="FNanchor_520_520" href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">520</a></p>

<p>Moderate men of both parties, wearied with the unceasing strife,
eagerly hailed the accommodation proposed by the papal legates,
and rejoiced at the prospect of peace. Erlembaldo, however, was
dissatisfied, and, visiting Rome, soon aroused a fresh cause of
quarrel. At the suggestion of Hildebrand he started the portentous
question of investitures, and on his return he endeavored to force
both clergy and laity to take an oath that in future their archbishops
should apply to the pope, and not to the emperor, for confirmation—thus
securing a chief devoted to the cause of reform. Guido sought
to anticipate this movement, and, in 1069, old and wearied with the
unending contention, he resigned his archbishopric to the subdeacon
Gotefrido, who had long been his principal adviser. The latter procured
his confirmation from Henry IV., but the Milanese, defrauded
of their electoral privileges, refused to acknowledge him. Erlembaldo
was not slow to take advantage of the popular feeling; a
tumult was readily excited, and Gotefrido was glad to escape at night
from the rebellious city. Guido added fresh confusion by asserting
that he had been deceived by Gotefrido, and by endeavoring to resume
his see. To this end he made a treaty with Erlembaldo, but
that crafty chieftain, obtaining possession of his person, imprisoned
him in the monastery of San Celso, and then proceeded to besiege
Gotefrido in Castiglione. The new archbishop defended himself
bravely, until, in 1071, Erlembaldo was forced to abandon the
enterprise.<a id="FNanchor_521_521" href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">521</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile another aspirant, Azzo, installed by Erlembaldo, fared
no better than his rivals. The people, unbidden guests, rushed in to
his inaugural banquet, unearthed him in the corner where he had
hidden himself, dragged him by the heels into the street, and, placing
him in a pulpit, forced him to swear that he would make no further
pretensions to the see; while the papal legate, who had presided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
over the solemnities, was glad to escape with his life. Azzo, however,
was recognized by Rome; he was released from the obligation of his
oath, and money was furnished to enable him to maintain his quarrel.
On the other hand, Henry IV. sent assistance to Gotefrido, which
enabled him to carry on the campaign with some vigor; but he was
unable to obtain a foothold in Milan. Azzo fled to Rome, and the
city remained without an archbishop and under an interdict launched
in 1074 by Hildebrand, who, in April, 1073, had succeeded to
Alexander II.<a id="FNanchor_522_522" href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">522</a></p>

<p>The Milanese were disposed to disregard the interdict, while
Erlembaldo, who now held undisputed command of the city—and,
indeed, of almost all Lombardy—used every effort to enforce respect
for it. At length, at Easter, 1075, he resolutely prevented the
solemnization of the sacred rites, and cast out the holy chrism which
the priests had persisted in preparing. This roused the populace to
resistance; both parties flew to arms, and, at the very commencement
of the fray, Erlembaldo fell mortally wounded under the shade
of the papal banner, which was still the emblem of his cause, and in
virtue of which he was canonized as a saintly martyr to the faith.
The Milanese, sinking all past animosities, united in promptly
sending an embassy to Henry IV. to congratulate him on the death
of the common enemy, and to request the appointment of another
archbishop. To this he responded by nominating Tedaldo, who was
duly consecrated, notwithstanding the pretensions of his competitors,
Gotefrido and Azzo. Tedaldo was the leader of the disaffected
bishops who, at the synod of Pavia, in 1076, excommunicated Pope
Gregory himself; and though, after the interview at Canosa, in
1077, the Lombards, disgusted with Henry’s voluntary humiliation
before that papal power which they had learned to despise, abandoned
the imperialists for a time, yet Tedaldo kept his seat until his
death in 1085, notwithstanding the repeated excommunications
launched against him by Gregory.<a id="FNanchor_523_523" href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">523</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the later years of this long and bloody controversy, it is evident
that the political element greatly complicated the religious ground of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
quarrel—that pope and emperor without made use of burgher and
noble within, and the latter took sides, as respects simony and sacerdotal
marriage, to further the ends of individual ambition. Still, the
disputed points of discipline were the ostensible causes of the struggle,
whatever might be the private aims of civic factions, or of imperial
and papal rivals; and these points gave a keener purpose to the
strife, and furnished an inexhaustible supply of recruits to each contending
faction. Thus, about the year 1070, a conference took place
at Milan between priests deputed by both sides, in which the question
of marriage was argued as earnestly as though it were the source of
all the intestine troubles.<a id="FNanchor_524_524" href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">524</a> So when, in 1073, Gregory, shortly after
his accession, addressed letters to Erlembaldo urging him to persevere
in the good work, and to the Lombard bishops commanding them to
assist him, the object of his labors is assumed to be the extirpation
of simony and the restoration of the clergy to the purity becoming
their sacred office.<a id="FNanchor_525_525" href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">525</a> And when, in 1076, the schismatic bishops,
under the lead of Tedaldo of Milan, met in council at Pavia to
renounce all obedience to Gregory, one of the articles of accusation
brought against him was that he separated husbands and wives, and
preferred licentiousness to marriage, thus giving, in their grounds of
complaint against him, especial prominence to his zeal for the introduction
of celibacy.<a id="FNanchor_526_526" href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">526</a></p>

<p>Yet at last the question of sacerdotal marriage sank out of sight
when the civil broils of Milan merged into the European quarrel
between the empire and papacy. When, in 1093, Henry IV. was
driven out of Italy by the revolt of his son Conrad, and the latter
was created King of Lombardy by Urban II. and the Countess
Matilda, the dependence of the young king upon the pope rendered
impossible any further open defiance of the laws of the church, and
public marriage there, as elsewhere, was doubtless replaced by secret
immorality.<a id="FNanchor_527_527" href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">527</a> The triumph of the sacerdotal party was consummated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
at the great council of Piacenza, held by Urban II. in February,
1095, to which prelates flocked from every part of Europe, and the
people gathered in immense numbers. If, as the chronicler informs
us, four thousand ecclesiastics and thirty thousand laymen assembled
on the occasion, and the sessions were held in the open air because
no building could contain the thronging masses, we may reasonably
attribute so unprecedented an assemblage to the wild religious ardor
which was about to culminate in the first Crusade. That council
condemned Nicolitism in the most absolute and peremptory manner,
and there is no reason to believe that the power of so formidable a
demonstration was lightly disregarded.<a id="FNanchor_528_528" href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">528</a> Yet in Milan, as we shall
see elsewhere throughout Europe, the custom of sacerdotal marriage
had become so thoroughly established that it could not be eradicated
suddenly. It continued to survive stubbornly after every attempt at
repression with more or less openness as the persecution of married
priests was more or less severe. A synod held in Milan in 1098 is
discreetly silent as to wedlock or concubinage among ecclesiastics,
though it is severe upon the concurrent vice of simony, and though
its prohibition of hereditary succession in church benefices and dignities
would show that marriage among their incumbents must have
been by no means infrequent. Moreover, even as late as 1152,
Mainerio Boccardo, a canon of Monza, in his will specifies that certain
provisions for the benefit of his brother canons shall not be
enjoyed by those who are married, thus proving that the Hildebrandine
reforms had not yet been successful, though Rome had long
since attained its object in breaking down the independence of the
Ambrosian church.<a id="FNanchor_529_529" href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">529</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is not to be supposed that the story of Milan is an exceptional
one. Perhaps the factions there were fiercer, and the contest more
prolonged, than elsewhere; but the same causes were at work in
other Italian cities, and were attended with results similar in character,
if differing in intensity. In Lucca, for instance, in 1051, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
find Leo IX., when confirming the possessions of the canons of the
cathedral church of St. Martin, expressing the hope that God would
liberate them from their married priests, who dissipated the property
of the foundation, while utterly unworthy of partaking of the divine
oblation.<a id="FNanchor_530_530" href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">530</a> His desire that they would live in concord and harmony
with their bishop was, however, not destined to be long gratified.
When St. Anselmo, in 1073, accepted the episcopate at the urgent
request of his friend, Gregory VII., he labored for years to reform
the dissolute lives of his clergy, until at length finding threats and
expostulations alike ineffectual, he implored the intervention of the
Countess Matilda. Even the sovereign of Tuscany was unable to
accomplish the submission of the recalcitrant ecclesiastics, and in
1074 St. Anselmo took advantage of the presence of Gregory VII.
in the city to invoke his interposition. The resolute pope, finding
his personal efforts fruitless, summoned the offenders to trial before
a court of bishops, presided over by the celebrated Pietro Igneo,
Bishop of Albano. Being condemned and excommunicated, they
resisted by force of arms, excited a rebellion in the city, drove out
St. Anselmo, and joined the imperialists; and when, in 1081, Guiberto
the anti-pope came to Italy, he consecrated their leader, a subdeacon
named Pietro, as bishop, in place of the exiled martyr.<a id="FNanchor_531_531" href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">531</a> In
Piacenza, the schismatics were guilty of excesses more deplorable,
for, not content with deposing Bonizo, who had been set over them
as bishop, they gave him the fullest honors of martyrdom by plucking
out his eyes and then cutting him to pieces.<a id="FNanchor_532_532" href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">532</a> Similar troubles
occurred in Parma, Modena, Reggio, and Pistoia, and it was not
until the death of their respective schismatic bishops that the
Countess Matilda was able to recover her authority in those places.</p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV">XIV.</a><br />

HILDEBRAND.</h2>


<p>Alexander II. died April 21st, 1073, and within twenty-four
hours the Archdeacon Hildebrand was elected as his successor—a
promptitude and unanimity which showed the general recognition of
his fitness for the high office. For more than twenty years he had
been the power behind the throne which had directed and given purpose
to the policy of Rome, and the assertion of his biographers that
his disinclination for the position had alone prevented his previous
elevation may readily be believed. Whether he was forced on the
present occasion to assent to the choice of the conclave, against his
earnest resistance, is, however, more problematical.</p>

<p>Hildebrand was the son of a poor carpenter of Soano, and had
been trained in the ascetic monachism of Cluny. Gifted by nature
with rare sagacity, unbending will, and indomitable spirit, imbued
with the principles of the False Decretals, and firmly believing in
the wildest pretensions of ecclesiastical supremacy, he had conceived
a scheme of hierarchical autocracy, which he regarded not only as
the imprescriptible right of the church, but also as the perfection of
human institutions. To the realization of this ideal he devoted his
life with a fiery zeal and unshaken purpose that shrank from no
obstacles, and to it he was ready to sacrifice not only the men who
stood in his path, but also the immutable principles of truth and
justice. All considerations were as dross compared with the one
object, and his own well-being and life were ventured as recklessly
as the peace of the world.</p>

<p>Such a man could comprehend the full importance of the rule of
celibacy, not alone as essential to the ascetic purity of the church,
but as necessary to the theocratic structure which he proposed to
elevate on the ruins of kingdoms and empires. The priest must be
a man set apart from his fellows, consecrated to the one holy purpose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
reverenced by the world as a being superior to human passions and
frailties, devoted, soul and body, to the interests of the church, and
distracted by no temporal cares and anxieties foreign to the welfare
of the great corporation of which he was a member. We have seen
the strenuous efforts which, for a quarter of a century, successive
pontiffs had unceasingly made to accomplish this reform, and we have
also seen how fruitlessly those efforts were expended on the passive
or active resistance of the priesthood. When Hildebrand took the
reins into his vigorous grasp, the change at once became manifest,
and the zeal of his predecessors appears lukewarm by comparison.
He had had ample leisure to note how inefficient was the ordinary
machinery to accomplish the result, and he hesitated not to call to
his assistance external powers; to give to the secular princes
authority over ecclesiastics at which enthusiastic churchmen stood
aghast, and to risk apparently the most precious immunities of the
church to secure the result. The end proved his wisdom, for the
power delegated to the laity for a special object was readily recalled,
after it had served its purpose, and the rebellious clerks were subdued
and rendered fit instruments in the lapse of time for humiliating
their temporary masters. In one respect, however, Hildebrand’s
policy proved a blunder. The faithful readily submitted to the
restoration of clerical immunity, but the idea that ecclesiastics forfeited
their privileges by sin became a favorite one with almost all
heretics, as we shall see hereafter in the case of the Albigenses,
Waldenses, Wickliffites, and Hussites, costing the church many a
desperate struggle.</p>

<p>To Gregory, as we must hereafter call him, was generally attributed,
by his immediate successors, the honor of introducing, or of
enforcing, the absolute chastity of the ministers of the altar. Some
chroniclers mention Alexander II. or Leo IX. as participating in the
struggle, but to his vigorous management its success was popularly
conceded.<a id="FNanchor_533_533" href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">533</a> He earned the tribute thoroughly, for during his whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
pontificate it seems to have been ever present to his thoughts, and
whatever were his preoccupations in his fearful struggle with the
empire, on which he risked the present and the future of the papacy,
he always had leisure to attend to the one subject in its minutest
details and in the remotest corner of Christendom.</p>

<p>Perhaps in this there may have been an unrecognized motive
urging him to action. Sprung from so humble an origin, he may
have sympathized with the democratic element, which rendered the
church the only career open to peasant and plebeian. He may have
felt that this was a source of hidden power, as binding the populations
more closely to the church, and as enabling it to press into
service an unknown amount of fresh and vigorous talent belonging
to men who would owe everything to the establishment which had
raised them from nothingness, and who would have no relationships
to embarrass their devotion. All this would be lost if, by legalizing
marriage, the hereditary transmission of benefices inevitably resulting
should convert the church into a separate caste of individual proprietors,
having only general interests in common, and lazily luxuriating
on the proceeds of former popular beneficence. To us,
retrospectively philosophizing, it further appears evident that if
celibacy were an efficient agent in obtaining for the church the
immense temporal power and spiritual authority which it enjoyed,
that very power and that authority rendered celibacy a necessity to
the welfare of civilization. When even the humblest priest came to
be regarded as a superior being, holding the keys of heaven in his
hand, and by the machinery of confession, absolution, and excommunication
wielding incalculable influence over each member of his
flock, it was well for both parties that the ecclesiastic should be free
from the ties of family and the vulgar ambition of race. It is easy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
to see how the churchmen could have selected matrimonial alliances
of the most politic and aggrandizing character; and as possession of
property and hereditary transmission of benefices would have necessarily
followed on the permission to marry, an ecclesiastical caste,
combining temporal and spiritual power in the most dangerous excess,
would have repeated in Europe the distinctions between the Brahman
and Sudra of India. The perpetual admission of self-made men into
the hierarchy, which distinguished the church even in times of the
most aristocratic feudalism, was for ages the only practical recognition
of the equality of man, and was one of the most powerful
causes at work during the Middle Ages to render rational liberty
eventually possible with advancing civilization. Looking therefore
upon the church as an instrumentality to effect certain beneficent
results in the course of human improvement, we may regard celibacy
as a necessary element of sacerdotalism, the abolition of which would
have required the entire destruction of the papal system and the
fundamental reconstruction of ecclesiastical institutions.</p>

<p>What we may now readily discern to have been a means, to
Gregory, however, was an end, and to the enforcement of celibacy as
necessary to that object he devoted himself with unrelenting vigor.
The belief that he was appointed of God, and set apart for the task
of cleansing the church of the Nicolitan heresy which had defied his
predecessors is well illustrated by the contemporary legend of some
pious Pisans, who, spending the night before his election in prayer
in the basilica of St. Peter, saw that holy saint himself traverse the
church accompanied by Hildebrand, whom he commanded to gather
some droppings of mares with which the sacred edifice was defiled, to
place them in a sack, and to carry them out on his shoulders.<a id="FNanchor_534_534" href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">534</a> The
severe austerity of his virtue, moreover, was displayed by his
admirers in the story that once, when dangerously ill, his niece came
to inquire as to his health. To relieve her anxiety he played with
her necklace, and jestingly asked if she wished to be married; but
on his recovery he found that he could no longer weep with due contrition
over his sins, and that he had lost the grace of repentance.
He long and vainly searched for the cause, and finally entreated his
friends to pray for him, when the Virgin appeared to one of them,
and sent word to Gregory that he had fallen from grace in conse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>quence
of the infraction of his vows committed in touching the
necklace of his niece.<a id="FNanchor_535_535" href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">535</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>His first movement on the subject appears to have been an epistle
addressed in November, 1073, to Gebhardt Archbishop of Salzburg,
taking him severely to task for his neglect in enforcing the canons
promulgated not long before in Rome, and ordering him to carry
them rigidly into effect among his clergy.<a id="FNanchor_536_536" href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">536</a> This, no doubt, was a
circular letter addressed to all the prelates of Christendom, and it
was but a preliminary step. Early in Lent of the next year (March,
1074), he held his first synod, which adopted a canon prohibiting
sacerdotal marriage, ordering that no one in future should be
admitted to orders without a vow of celibacy, and renewing the legislation
of Nicholas II. which commanded the people not to attend the
ministrations of those whose lives were a violation of the rule.<a id="FNanchor_537_537" href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">537</a>
There was nothing in the terms of this more severe than what had
been decreed in innumerable previous councils—indeed, it was by no
means as threatening as many decretals of recent date; but Gregory
was resolved that it should not remain, like them, a mere protest,
and he took immediate measures to have it enforced wherever the
authority of Rome extended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>

<p>The controversy as respects Italy has already been so fully
described that to dilate upon it further would be superfluous. Even
though Alexander II. in his later years had shrunk somewhat from
the contest, yet from Naples to the Tyrol the question was thoroughly
understood, and its results depended more upon political
revolutions than on ecclesiastical exertions. Beyond the Alps, however,
the efforts of preceding popes had thus far proved wholly nugatory,
and on this field Gregory now bent all his energies. The new
canon was sent to all the bishops of Europe, with instructions to
promulgate it throughout their respective dioceses, and to see that
it was strictly obeyed; while legates were sent in every direction
to support these commands with their personal supervision and
exertion.<a id="FNanchor_538_538" href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">538</a></p>

<p>That the course which Gregory thus adopted was essentially different
from that pursued by his predecessors is amply attested by the
furious storm which these measures aroused. The clergy protested
in the most energetic terms that they would rather abandon their
calling than their wives; they denounced Gregory as a madman and
a heretic, who expected to compel men to live as angels, and who in
his folly, while denying to natural affection its accustomed and proper
gratification, would open the door to indiscriminate licentiousness;
and they tauntingly asked where, when he should have driven them
from the priesthood, he expected to find the angels who were to
replace them.<a id="FNanchor_539_539" href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">539</a> Even those who favored celibacy condemned the
means adopted as injudicious, contrary to the canons, and leading to
scandals more injurious to the church than the worst of heresies.<a id="FNanchor_540_540" href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">540</a>
Gregory paid little heed to threats or remonstrances, but sent legate
after legate to accuse the bishops of their inertness, and to menace
them with deposition if they should neglect to carry out the canon
to the letter, and he accompanied these measures with others of even
more practically efficient character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<p>The bishops, in fact, were placed in a most embarrassing position,
which may be understood from the adventures of three prelates, who
took different positions with regard to the wishes of Gregory—Otho
of Constance, who leaned to the side of the clergy; St. Altmann of
Passau, who was an enthusiastic papalist; and Siegfrid of Mainz,
who was a trimmer afraid of both parties.</p>

<p>To Otho, Gregory, in 1074, sent the canons of the synod inhibiting
marriage and simony, with orders to use every exertion to secure
the compliance of his clergy. Otho apparently did not manifest
much eagerness to undertake the unpopular task, and Gregory lost
little time in calling him to account. Before the year expired, we
find the pope addressing a second epistle to the bishop, angrily
accusing him of disobedience in permitting the ministration of married
priests, and summoning him to answer for his contumacy at a
synod to be held in Rome during the approaching Lent. Nor was
this all, for at the same time he wrote to the clergy and people of
the diocese, informing them of the disobedience of their bishop and
of his summons to trial, commanding them, in case of his persistent
rebellion, to no longer obey or reverence him as bishop, and formally
releasing them from all subjection to him. Otho doubtless considered
it imprudent to show himself at the synod of 1075; consequently
in that of 1076 he was excommunicated and deprived of his
episcopal functions. During the autumn of the same year, however,
the legate Altmann of Passau restored him to communion at Ulm,
but without granting him the privilege of officiating. Otho disregarded
this restriction, and not only persisted in exercising his functions,
but openly favored and protected the married clergy. For
this Gregory absolved his flock from all obedience to him, whereupon
Otho abandoned the Catholic party and formally joined the imperialists,
who were then engaged in the effort to depose Gregory.
From some motives of policy, the pope granted the hardened sinner
three years for repentance, at the expiration of which, in 1080, he
sent Altmann to Constance to superintend the election of another
bishop. The new incumbent, however, proved incapable through
bodily infirmity; and, in 1084, Otto of Ostia was sent to Constance,
and under his auspices Gebhardt was elected bishop, and duly consecrated
in 1085.<a id="FNanchor_541_541" href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">541</a> Evidently Gregory was not a man to abandon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
his purpose, and those who opposed him could not count upon
perpetual immunity.</p>

<p>St. Altmann of Passau was renowned for his piety and the strictness
of his religious observance. When the canon of 1074 reached
him, he assembled his clergy, read it to them, and adjured them to
pay to it the respect which was requisite. His eloquence was wasted;
the clerks openly refused obedience, and defended themselves by immemorial
custom, and by the fact that none of their predecessors had
been called upon to endure so severe and unnatural a regulation.
Finding the occasion unpropitious, the pious Altmann dissembled;
he assured his clergy that he was perfectly willing to indulge them
if the papal mandate would permit it, and with this he dismissed
them. He allowed the matter to lie in abeyance until the high feast
of St. Stephen, the patron saint of the church, which was always
attended by the magnates of the diocese. Then, without giving
warning of his intentions, he suddenly mounted the pulpit, read to
the assembled clergy and laity the letters of the pope, and threatened
exemplary punishment for disobedience. Though thus taken at
advantage and by surprise, the clerks were not disposed to submit.
A terrible tumult at once arose, and the crafty saint would have been
torn to pieces had it not been for the strenuous interference of the
nobles, aided, as his biographer assures us, by the assistance of God.
The clergy continued their resistance, and when, not long after, the
empire and papacy became involved in internecine strife, they sought
the protection of Henry IV., who marched upon Passau, and drove
out St. Altmann and his faction. How unbending was this opposition,
and how successfully it was maintained, is manifest from the
fact that when St. Altmann at length returned to his diocese as papal
legate, about the year 1081, even Gregory felt it necessary to use
policy rather than force, and instructed him to yield to the pressure
of the evil times, and to reserve the strict enforcement of the reform
for a more fortunate period.<a id="FNanchor_542_542" href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">542</a> The political question had thus, for
the moment, overshadowed the religious one.</p>

<p>The archiepiscopate of Mainz was, both temporally and spiritually,
one of the most powerful of the ecclesiastical principalities of Germany.
To the Archbishop Siegfrid, Gregory sent the canon of
1074 with instructions similar to those contained in his epistle to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
Otho of Constance. In reply, Siegfrid promised implicit obedience;
but, recognizing the almost insuperable difficulties of the task assigned
him, he temporized, and gave his clergy six months in which to make
up their minds, exhorting them to render willing obedience and relieve
him from the necessity of employing coercion. At the expiration of
the period, in October, 1074, he assembled a synod at Erfurt, where
he boldly insisted that they should give up their wives or abandon
their functions and their benefices. Their arguments and entreaties
were in vain. Finding him immovable, they retired for consultation,
when some proposed to separate and return home at once, without
further parley, and thus elude giving sanction to the new regulations;
while bolder spirits urged that it would be better to put the archbishop
to instant death, before he could promulgate so execrable a
decree, thus leaving for posterity a shining example, which would
prevent any of his successors from attempting so abominable an
enterprise.</p>

<p>Siegfrid’s friends advised him of the turn which affairs were likely
to take. He therefore sent to his clergy a request that they would
reassemble in synod, promising that he would take the first opportunity
to apply to Rome for a relaxation of the canon. They agreed
to this, and, on meeting them the next day, Siegfrid astutely started
the question of his claims on the Thuringian tithes, which had
shortly before been settled by the Saxon war. Indignant at this,
the Thuringian clergy raised a tumult, flew to arms, and the synod
broke up in the utmost confusion. In December, Gregory wrote to
the shuffling archbishop an angry letter, reproaching him with his
lukewarmness in the cause, and ordering him to present himself at
the synod announced for the coming Lent. Siegfrid obediently went
to Rome, but was with difficulty admitted to communion. What
promises he made to obtain it were not kept, for again in September,
1075, Gregory addressed him with commands to enforce the canons.
Stimulated by this, Siegfrid convoked a synod at Mainz in October,
where the Bishop of Coire appeared with a papal mandate threatening
him with degradation and expulsion if he failed in compelling
the priests to abandon either their wives or their ministry. Thus
goaded, Siegfrid did his best, but the whole body of the clergy raised
such a clamor and made demonstrations so active and so formidable
that the archbishop saw little prospect of escaping with life. The
danger from his mutinous flock was more instant and pressing than
that from the angry pope; his resolution gave way, and he dissolved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
the synod, declaring that he washed his hands of the affair, and that
Gregory might deal as he saw fit with a matter which was beyond
his power to control. Thus placed between the upper and the nether
millstone, it is not to be wondered at if Siegfrid took refuge in the
party of the imperialists, nor that his name stands at the head of the
list of bishops who in 1076 passed judgment on Gregory, and pronounced
that he had forfeited all claim to the papacy; neither is it
surprising that Gregory lost no time in excommunicating him at
the Roman synod of the same year.<a id="FNanchor_543_543" href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">543</a></p>

<p>These examples are sufficient to illustrate the difficulties with
which Gregory had to contend, and the manner in which he endeavored
to overcome them. The incidents are by no means exceptional,
and his marvellous vigor and energy in supervising the
movement everywhere, encouraging the zealous co-worker and punishing
the lukewarm and indifferent, are abundantly attested by his
correspondence. He apparently had an eye on every corner of
Europe, and lost no opportunity of enforcing his views with threats
or promises, as the case might seem to demand.<a id="FNanchor_544_544" href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">544</a></p>

<p>It did not take long, however, to convince him that he could count
upon no efficient assistance from the hierarchy, and that if the church
was to be purified, it must be purified from without, and not from
within. To the unutterable horror of those strict churchmen who
regarded the immunity from all temporal supervision or jurisdiction
as one of the most precious of ecclesiastical privileges, he took, as
early as 1074, the decided and unprecedented step of authorizing the
laity to withdraw their obedience from all prelates and priests who
disregarded the canons of the Holy See on the subjects of simony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
and incontinence.<a id="FNanchor_545_545" href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> This principle, once adopted, was followed up
with his customary unalterable resolution. In October, 1074, he
wrote to a certain Count Albert, exhorting him not to mind what
the simoniacal and concubinary priests might say, but, in spite of
them, to persist in enforcing the orders which emanated from Rome.
Still more menacing was an epistle addressed in January, 1075, to
Rodolf, Duke of Swabia, and Bertolf, Duke of Carinthia, commanding
them—“whatever the bishops may say or may not say concerning
this, do you in no manner receive the ministrations of those
who owe promotion or ordination to simony, or whom you know to
be guilty of concubinage ... and, as far as you can, do you prevent,
by force if necessary, all such persons from officiating. And
if any shall presume to prate and say that it is not your business,
tell them to come to us and dispute about the obedience which we
thus enjoin upon you”—and adding a bitter complaint of the archbishops
and bishops who, with rare exceptions, had taken no steps
to put an end to these execrable customs, or to punish the guilty.<a id="FNanchor_546_546" href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">546</a></p>

<p>These extraordinary measures called forth indignant denunciations
on the part of ecclesiastics, for these letters were circulars sent to all
the princes on whom he could depend, and he insured their publicity
by causing similar orders to be published in the churches themselves.
Thus Theodoric, Bishop of Verdun, who had inclined to the side of
Gregory and had secretly left the Assembly of Utrecht in 1076 to
avoid countenancing by his presence the excommunication then pronounced
against the pope, in a letter to Gregory bitterly reproaches
his own folly in promulgating the decretal and in not foreseeing its
effect as destructive to the peace of the church, to the safety of the
clerical order, and as creating a disturbance which threatened even the
Christian faith.<a id="FNanchor_547_547" href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">547</a> So Henry, Bishop of Speyer, indignantly denounced
him as having destroyed the authority of the bishops and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
subjected the church to the madness of the people;<a id="FNanchor_548_548" href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> and when the
bishops, at the Diet of Worms, threw off their allegiance to him, one of
the reasons alleged, in Henry’s letter to him, is the surrender which
he had made of the church to the laity.<a id="FNanchor_549_549" href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">549</a> Yet Gregory was not to
be diverted from his course, and he was at least successful in rousing
the Teutonic church from the attitude of passive resistance which
threatened to render his efforts futile. The princes of Germany,
who were already intriguing with Gregory for support in their
perennial revolts against their sovereign, were delighted to seize the
opportunity of at once obliging the pope, creating disturbance at
home, and profiting by the church property which they could manage
to get into their hands by ejecting the unfortunate married priests.
They accordingly proceeded to exercise, without delay and to the
fullest extent, the unlimited power so suddenly granted them over a
class which had hitherto successfully defied their jurisdiction; nor
was it difficult to excite the people to join in the persecution of those
who had always held themselves as superior beings, and who were
now pronounced by the highest authority in the church to be sinners
of the worst description. The ignorant populace were naturally
captivated by the idea of the vicarious mortification with which their
own errors were to be redeemed by the abstinence imposed upon
their pastors, and they were not unreasonably led to believe that
they were themselves deeply wronged by the want of purity in their
ecclesiastics. Add to this the attraction which persecution always
possesses for the persecutor, and the license of plunder so dear to a
turbulent and barbarous age, and it is not difficult to comprehend the
motive power of the storm which burst over the heads of the secular
clergy, and which must have satisfied by its severity the stern soul
of Gregory himself.</p>

<p>A contemporary writer, whose name has been lost, but who is
supposed by Dom Martène to have been a priest of Trèves, gives us
a very lively picture of the horrors which ensued, and as he shows
himself friendly in principle to the reform attempted, his account
may be received as trustworthy. He describes what amounted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
almost to a dissolution of society, slave betraying master and master
slave; friend informing against friend; snares and pitfalls spread
before the feet of all; faith and truth unknown. The peccant priests
suffered terribly. Some, reduced to utter poverty, and unable to
bear the scorn and contempt of those from whom they had been wont
to receive honor and respect, wandered off as homeless exiles; others,
mutilated by the indecent zeal of ardent puritans, were carried
around to exhibit their shame and misery; others, tortured in
lingering death, bore to the tribunal on high the testimony of blood-guiltiness
against their persecutors; while others, again, in spite of
danger, secretly continued the connections which exposed them to all
these cruelties. In the midst of these troubles, as might be expected,
the offices of religion were wholly neglected; the new-born babe
received no holy baptism; the dying penitent expired without the
saving viaticum; the sinner could cleanse his soul by no confession
and absolution; and the devotee could no longer be strengthened by
the daily sacrifice of the mass.<a id="FNanchor_550_550" href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">550</a> Another writer, of nearly the same
date, relates with holy horror how the laity shook off all the obedience
which they owed to their pastors, and, despising the sacraments prepared
by them, trod the Eucharist under foot and cast out the sacred
wine, administered baptism with unlicensed hands, and substituted
for the holy chrism the filthy wax collected from their own ears.<a id="FNanchor_551_551" href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">551</a></p>

<p>When such was the fate of the pastors, it is easy to imagine the
misery inflicted on their unfortunate wives. A zealous admirer of
Gregory relates with pious gratulation, as indubitable evidence of
divine vengeance, how, maddened by their wrongs, some of them
openly committed suicide, while others were found dead in the beds
which they had sought in perfect health; and this being proof of
their possession by the devil, they were denied Christian sepulture.
The case of Count Manigold of Veringen affords a not uninstructive
instance of the frightful passions aroused by the relentless cruelty
which thus branded them as infamous, tore them from their families,
and cast them adrift upon a mocking world. The count had put in
force the orders of Gregory with strict severity throughout his estates
in the Swabian Alps. One miserable creature thus driven from her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
husband swore that the count should undergo the same fate, and, in
the blindness of her rage, she poisoned the Countess of Veringen,
whose widowed husband, overwhelmed with grief, sought no second
mate.<a id="FNanchor_552_552" href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">552</a></p>

<p>Nor was the customary machinery of miracles wanting to stimulate
the zeal of the faithful in this pious work, and to convince the
doubters whose worldly wisdom or humanity might shrink from the
task assigned them. Unchaste priests at Mass would find sudden
blasts of wind overturn the cup, and scatter the sacred wine upon
the ground, or the holy wafer would be miraculously snatched out of
their polluted hands. The saintly virgin Herluca saw in a vision
the Saviour, with his wounds profusely bleeding, and was told that
if she desired to escape a repetition of the horrifying spectacle, she
must no longer be present at the ministrations of Father Richard,
the officiating priest of her convent—a revelation which she employed
effectually upon him and his parishioners. The same holy maiden
being observed staring intently out of the window, declared, upon
being questioned, that she had seen the soul of the priest of Rota
carried off by demons to eternal punishment; and, on sending to his
habitation, it was found that he had expired at the very moment.<a id="FNanchor_553_553" href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">553</a>
Puerile as these tales may seem to us, they were stern realities to
those against whose weaknesses they were directed, and whose sufferings
were thus enhanced by every art which bigotry could bring
to bear upon the credulous passions of a barbarous populace.</p>

<p>It cannot be a matter of surprise if men, who were thus threatened
with almost every worldly evil, should seek to defend themselves by
means as violent as those employed by their persecutors. Their
cruel intensity of fear is aptly illustrated by what occurred at Cambrai
in 1077, where a man was actually burned at the stake as a
heretic for declaring his adhesion to the Hildebrandine doctrine that
the masses of simoniacal and concubinary priests were not to be
listened to by the faithful.<a id="FNanchor_554_554" href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">554</a> So, in the same year, when the pseudo-emperor
Rodolf of Swabia was elected by the papalists at the Diet
of Forcheim as a competitor to Henry IV., he manifested his zeal to
suppress the heresies of avarice and lust by refusing the ministration
of a simoniacal deacon in the coronation solemnities at Mainz. The
clergy of that city, who had so successfully resisted, for two years,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
the efforts of their archbishop Siegfrid to reduce them to subjection
to the canons, were dismayed at the prospect of coming under the
control of so pious a prince, who would indubitably degrade them or
compel them to give up their wives and simoniacally acquired churches.
They therefore stirred up a tumult among the citizens, who were
ready to espouse their cause; and when Rodolf left his palace for
vespers, he was attacked by the people. The conflict was renewed
on his return, causing heavy slaughter on both sides, and though the
townsmen were driven back, Rodolf was forced to leave the city.<a id="FNanchor_555_555" href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">555</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This incident affords us a glimpse into the political aspects of the
reform. In the tremendous struggle between the empire and papacy,
Gregory allied himself with all the disaffected princes of Germany,
and they were careful to justify their rebellions under the specious
pretext of zeal for the apostolic church. They of course, therefore,
entered heartily into his measures for the restoration of ecclesiastical
discipline, and professed the sternest indignation towards those whom
he placed under the ban. Thus, after Henry, in 1076, had caused
his bishops to declare the degradation of Gregory, when the revolted
princes held their assembly at Tribur, and in turn decreed the deposition
of Henry, they used the utmost caution to exclude all who had
communicated with Henry since his excommunication, together with
those who had obtained preferment by simony, or who had joined in
communion with married priests.<a id="FNanchor_556_556" href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">556</a> The connection, indeed, became
so marked that the papalists throughout Germany were stigmatized
by the name of Patarini—a term which had acquired so sinister a
significance in the troubles of Milan.<a id="FNanchor_557_557" href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">557</a> In this state of affairs it was
natural that common enmities and common dangers should unite the
persecuted clergy and the hunted sovereign. Yet it is a curious
illustration of the influence which the denunciations of sacerdotal
marriage had exercised over the public mind, that although Henry
tacitly protected the simoniacal and married ecclesiastics, and although
they rallied around him and afforded him unquestionable and invaluable
aid, still he never ventured openly to defend them. Writers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
both then and since have attributed the measure of success with
which he sustained the fluctuating contest, and the consequent sufferings
of the unbending pope, to the efforts of the recalcitrant clergy
who resisted the yoke imposed on them by Rome.<a id="FNanchor_558_558" href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">558</a> Yet Henry had
formally and absolutely pledged his assistance when Gregory commenced
his efforts, and had repeated the promise in 1075;<a id="FNanchor_559_559" href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> and from
this position he never definitely withdrew. Even when the schismatic
bishops of his party, at the synod of Brixen, in 1080, pronounced
sentence of deposition on Gregory, and filled the assumed
vacancy with an anti-pope, the man whom they elected never ventured
to dispute the principle of Gregory’s reforms, although the
Lombard prelates, at that very time, were warmly defending their
married and simoniacal clergy.<a id="FNanchor_560_560" href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">560</a> Indeed, Guiberto of Ravenna, or
Clement III., took occasion to express his detestation of concubinage
in language nearly as strong as that of his rival, although he threatened
with excommunication the presumptuous laymen who should
refuse to receive the sacraments of priests that had not been regularly
tried and condemned at his own papal tribunal.<a id="FNanchor_561_561" href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">561</a> In thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
endeavoring to place himself as a shield between the suffering priesthood
and the persecuting populace, he was virtually striving to
annul the reforms of Gregory, since in no other way could they be
carried into effect; but he was forced to coincide with Gregory as to
the principle which dictated those reforms. Notwithstanding all
these precautions, however, the papalists were not disposed to allow
their opponents to escape the responsibility of the alliance which
brought them so much strength by dividing the church, and no
opportunity was lost of stigmatizing them for the license which they
protected. When Guiberto and his cardinals were driven out of
Rome in 1084 by Robert Guiscard and his Normans, the flying
prelates were ridiculed, not for their cowardice, but for their shaven
chins, and the wives and concubines whom they publicly carried
about with them.<a id="FNanchor_562_562" href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">562</a></p>

<p>At length Henry and his partisans appear to have felt it necessary
to make some public declaration to relieve themselves from the odium
of supporting and favoring a practice which was popularly regarded
as a heresy and a scandal. When the papalists, under their King
Hermann, at the Easter of 1085 (April 20th), convened a general
assembly of their faction at Quedlinburg and again forbade all commerce
with women to those in orders,<a id="FNanchor_563_563" href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">563</a> the imperialists lost no time
in putting themselves on the same record with their rivals. Three
weeks later Henry gathered around him, at Mainz, all the princes
and prelates who professed allegiance to him, for the purpose of
securing the succession to his eldest son, Conrad, as King of Germany,
and there, in that solemn diet, marriage was formally prohibited
to the priesthood.<a id="FNanchor_564_564" href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">564</a> Gregory was then lying on his dying
bed in the far off castle of Salerno, and ere the news could reach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
him he was past the vanities of earthly triumph. Could he have
known, however, that the cause for which he had risked the integrity
and independence of the church had thus received the support of its
bitterest enemies, and that his unwavering purpose had thus achieved
the moral victory of forcing his adversaries to range themselves under
his banner, his spirit would have rejoiced, and his confidence in the
ultimate success of the great theocratic system, for the maintenance
of which he was thus expiring in exile, would have softened the
sorrows of a life which closed in the darkness and doubt of defeat.</p>

<h2><a name="XV" id="XV">XV.</a><br />

CENTRAL EUROPE.</h2>


<p>Hildebrand had passed away, leaving to his successors the legacy
of inextinguishable hate and unattained ambition. Nor was the
reform for which he had labored as yet by any means secured in
practice, even though his opponents had been reduced to silence or
had been forced to render a formal adhesion to the canons which he
had proclaimed so boldly.</p>

<p>The cause of asceticism, it is true, had gained many adherents
among the laity. Throughout Germany, husbands and wives separated
from each other in vast numbers, and devoted themselves to
the service of the church, without taking vows or assuming ecclesiastical
garments; while those who were unmarried renounced the
pleasures of the world, and, placing themselves under the direction
of spiritual guides, abandoned themselves entirely to religious duties.
To such an extent did this prevail, that the pope was applied to for
his sanction, which he eagerly granted, and the movement doubtless
added strength to the party of reform.<a id="FNanchor_565_565" href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">565</a> Yet but little had thus far
been really gained in purifying the church itself, notwithstanding the
fearful ordeal through which its ministers had passed.</p>

<p>As for Germany, the indomitable energy of Henry IV., unrepressed
by defeat and unchilled by misfortune, had at length achieved
a virtual triumph over his banded enemies. But four bishops of the
Empire—those of Wurzburg, Passau, Worms, and Constance—owed
allegiance to Urban II. All the other dioceses were filled by schismatics,
who rendered obedience to the anti-pope Clement. In 1089
the Catholic or papalist princes offered to lay down their arms and
do homage to Henry if he would acknowledge Urban and make his
peace with the true church. The emperor, however, had a pope who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
suited him, and he entertained too lively a recollection of the trials
from which he was escaping to open the door to a renewal of the
papal pretensions, which he had at length successfully defied, nor
would he consent to stigmatize his faithful prelates as schismatics.<a id="FNanchor_566_566" href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">566</a>
He therefore pursued his own course, and Guiberto of Ravenna
enjoyed the honors of the popedom, checkered by alternate vicissitudes
of good and evil fortune, until removed by death in the year
1100,<a id="FNanchor_567_567" href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">567</a> his sanctity attested by the numerous miracles wrought at his
tomb, which only needed the final success of the imperialist cause to
enrich the calendar with a St. Clement in place of a St. Gregory
and a St. Urban.<a id="FNanchor_568_568" href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">568</a></p>

<p>Under such auspices, no very zealous maintenance of ecclesiastical
discipline was to be expected. If Clement’s sensibilities were
humored by a nominal reprobation of sacerdotal marriage, he could
scarcely ask for more or insist that Henry should rekindle the embers
of disaffection by enforcing the odious rules which had proved so
powerful a cause of trouble to their authors and his enemies. Accordingly,
it cannot surprise us to observe that Urban II., in following
out the views of his predecessors, felt it necessary to adopt
measures even more violent than those which in Gregory’s hands had
caused so much excitement and confusion, but whose inefficiency was
confessed by the very effort to supplement them. In 1089, the year
after his consecration, Urban published at the council of Amalfi a
decree by which, as usual, married ecclesiastics were sentenced to
deposition, and bishops who permitted such irregularities were suspended;
but where Gregory had been content with ejecting husbands
and wives, and with empowering secular rulers to enforce the edict
on recalcitrants, Urban, with a refinement of cruelty, reduced the
unfortunate women to slavery, and offered their servitude as a bribe
to the nobles who should aid in thus purifying the church.<a id="FNanchor_569_569" href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">569</a> If this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
infamous canon did not work misery so wide-spread as the comparatively
milder decretals of Gregory, it was because the power of Urban
was circumscribed by the schism, while he was apparently himself
ashamed or afraid to promulgate it in regions where obedience was
doubtful. When Pibo, Bishop of Toul, in the same year, 1089, sent
an envoy to ask his decision on various points of discipline, including
sacerdotal marriage (the necessity of such inquiry showing the futility
of previous efforts), Urban transmitted the canons of Amalfi in response,
but omitted this provision, which well might startle the honest
German mind.<a id="FNanchor_570_570" href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> Perhaps, on reflection, Urban may himself have
wished to disavow the atrocity, for in a subsequent council, when
again attacking the ineradicable sin, he contented himself with simply
forbidding all such marriages, and ordering all persons who were
bound by orders or vows to be separated from their wives or concubines,
and to be subjected to due penance.<a id="FNanchor_571_571" href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">571</a></p>

<p>Yet even in those regions of Germany which persevered in resisting
Henry and in recognizing Urban as pope, the persecution of twenty
years was still unsuccessful, and the people had apparently relapsed
into condoning the wickedness of their pastors. In an assembly held
at Constance in 1094, it was deemed necessary to impose a fine on
all who should be present at the services performed by priests who
had transgressed the canons.<a id="FNanchor_572_572" href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">572</a> When this was the case in the
Catholic provinces, it is easy to imagine that in the imperialist
territories the thunders of Gregory and Urban had long since been
forgotten, and that marrying and giving in marriage were practised
with as little scruple as ever. A fair illustration, indeed, of the
amount of respect paid to the rules of discipline is afforded by a discussion
on the choice of a successor to Cosmo Bishop of Prague, who
died in 1098. Duke Brecislas, in filling the vacancy with his
chaplain Hermann, endeavored to rebut the arguments of those who
objected to the foreign birth of the appointee by urging that fact as
a recommendation, since, as a stranger, he would not be pressed
upon by a crowd of kindred nor be burdened with the care of
children, thus showing that the native priesthood, as a general rule,
were heads of families.<a id="FNanchor_573_573" href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">573</a> For this, moreover, they could not plead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
ignorance, for a Bohemian penitential of the period expressly prohibits
priests from having companions whose society could give rise
to suspicion of any kind.<a id="FNanchor_574_574" href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">574</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At length the duel which, for more than thirty years, Henry had
so gallantly fought with the successors of St. Peter drew to a close.
Ten years of supremacy he had enjoyed in Germany, and he looked
forward to the peaceful decline of his unquiet life, when the treacherous
calm was suddenly disturbed. Papal intrigues in 1093 had
caused the parricidal revolt of his eldest born, the weak and vacillating
Conrad, whose early death had then extinguished the memory
of his crime. That unnatural rebellion had gained for Rome the
North of Italy; and as the emperor’s second son, Henry, grew to
manhood, he, too, was marked as a fit instrument to pierce his
father’s heart, and to extend the domination of the church by the
foulest wrongs that man can perpetrate. The startling revolution
which in 1105 precipitated Henry from a throne to a prison, from
an absolute monarch to a captive embracing the knees of his son
and pleading for his wretched life, established forever the supremacy
of the papacy over Germany. The consequent enforcement of the
law of celibacy became only a question of time.</p>

<p>As the excuse for the rebellion was the necessity of restoring the
empire to the communion of Rome, one of the first measures of the
conspirators was the convocation of a council to be held at Nordhausen,
May 29, 1105, and one of the objects specified for its action
was the expulsion of all married priests.<a id="FNanchor_575_575" href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">575</a> The council was duly held,
and duly performed its work of condemning the heresy which permitted
benefices to be occupied and sacred functions exercised by
those who were involved in the ties of matrimony.<a id="FNanchor_576_576" href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">576</a> Pope Paschal
II. was not remiss in his share of the ceremony, by which he was
to receive the fruits of his treacherous intrigues. The following
year a great council was held at Guastalla, where, after interminable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
discussions as to the propriety of receiving without re-ordination those
who had compromised themselves or who had been ordained by schismatics,
he admitted into the fold all the repentant ecclesiastics of the
party of Henry IV.<a id="FNanchor_577_577" href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">577</a> The text of the canon granting this boon to
the imperialist clergy bears striking testimony to the completeness
of the separation which had existed between the Teutonic and the
Roman churches in stating that throughout the empire scarce any
Catholic ecclesiastics were to be found.<a id="FNanchor_578_578" href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">578</a> It scarcely needed the
declaration which Paschal made in 1107 at the synod of Troyes,
condemning married priests to degradation and deprivation,<a id="FNanchor_579_579" href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">579</a> to show
that the doctrines of Damiani and Hildebrand were thenceforth to
be the law of the empire.</p>

<p>The question thus was definitely settled in prohibiting the priests
of Germany from marrying or from retaining the wives whom they
had taken previous to ordination. It was settled, indeed, in the rolls
of parchment which recorded the decrees of councils and the trading
bargains of pope and kaiser, yet the perennial struggle continued,
and the parchment roll for yet awhile was powerless before the passions
of man, who did not cease to be man because his crown was
shaven and his shoulders wore cope and stole.</p>

<p>Cosmo, who was Dean of Prague, who had been bred to the church,
and had been promoted to the priesthood in 1099, chronicles, in 1118,
the death of Boseteha, his wife, in terms which show that no separation
had ever occurred between them; and five years later he alludes
to his son Henry in a manner to indicate that there was no irregularity
in such relationship, nor aught that would cause him to forfeit
the respect of his contemporaries in acknowledging it.<a id="FNanchor_580_580" href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">580</a> Even more
to the point is the case of a pious priest, his friend, who, on the death
of his wife (“presbytera”), made a vow that he would have no further
intercourse with women. Cosmo relates that the unaccustomed deprivation
proved harder than he had expected, and that for some years
he was tortured with burning temptation. Finding at length that
his resolution was giving way, he resolved to imitate St. Benedict in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
conquering the flesh; and having no suitable solitude for the execution
of his purpose, he took a handful of nettles to his chamber,
where, casting off his garments, he thrashed himself so unmercifully
that for three days he lay moribund. Then he hung the nettles in a
conspicuous position on his wall, that he might always have before
his eyes so significant a memento and warning.<a id="FNanchor_581_581" href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">581</a> Cosmo’s admiration
for this, as a rare and almost incredible exhibition of priestly virtue
and fortitude, shows how few were capable of even remaining widowers,
while the whole story proves that not only the clergy were
free to marry, but also that it was only the voluntary vow that prevented
a second marriage. At the close of the century Pietro, Cardinal
of Santa Maria in Via Lata, sent as Legate to Bohemia by
Celestin III., was much scandalized at this state of affairs; and when
a number of postulants for holy orders were assembled in the church
of St. Vitus at Prague, before ordaining them he pronounced a discourse
on the subject of celibacy and demanded that they should all
swear to preserve continence. Thereupon all the priests who were
present rushed forward and urged them not to assume an obligation
hitherto unknown, and when the Cardinal ordered the Archdeacon
to repress their somewhat active demonstrations, they proceeded to
pummel that unhappy official and the tumult was with difficulty
repressed by the soldiery who were summoned. The legate sentenced
some of the rioters to be starved to death in prison and the rest to
be exiled—a wholesome severity which broke the spirit of the
Bohemian priesthood and led to the introduction of celibacy.<a id="FNanchor_582_582" href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">582</a></p>

<p>That this state of things was not confined to the wild Bohemian
Marches, but obtained throughout Germany in general, is sufficiently
attested by the fact that when Innocent II. was driven out of Rome
by the anti-pope Anaclet, and was wandering throughout Europe
begging recognition, he held, in conjunction with the Emperor
Lothair, in 1131, a council at Liége, where he procured the adoption
of a canon prohibiting priestly marriage or attendance on the mass
of married priests. Not only does the necessity of this fresh legislation
show that previous enactments had become obsolete, but the
manner in which these proceedings are referred to by the chroniclers
plainly indicates that it took the Teutonic mind somewhat by sur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>prise,
and that the efforts of Gregory and Urban had not only
remained without result, but had become absolutely forgotten.<a id="FNanchor_583_583" href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">583</a></p>

<p>If these proceedings of Innocent had any effect, it was only to
make matters worse. The pious Rupert, Abbot of Duits, writing a
few years later, deplores the immorality of the priesthood, who not
only entered into forbidden marriages, but, knowing them to be
illegal, had no scruple in multiplying the tie, considering it to be,
at their pleasure, devoid of all binding force.<a id="FNanchor_584_584" href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">584</a> And in Liége itself,
where Innocent had held his council, Bishop Albero, whose episcopate
commenced in 1135, permitted his priests to celebrate their
marriages openly, so that, as we are told, the citizens rather preferred
to give their daughters in marriage to them than to laymen;
and the naïve remark of the chronicler that the clergy gave up
keeping concubines in secret and took wives openly would seem to
show that the cause of morality had not gained during the temporary
restriction imposed by Innocent.<a id="FNanchor_585_585" href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">585</a> It was not to much purpose that
Albero was deprived of his see for this laxity, for the same state of
things continued. No province of Germany was more orthodox than
Salzburg, yet the archdeacon of the archiepiscopal church there,
writing in 1175, bewails the complete demoralization of his clergy,
whom he was utterly unable to reform. Priests who were content
with their own wives and did not take those of other men were
reputed virtuous and holy; and he complains that in his own archidiaconate
he was powerless to prevent the ordination and ministry of
the sons of priests, even while they were living in open adultery
with women whom they had taken from their husbands.<a id="FNanchor_586_586" href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">586</a> How little
sympathy, indeed, all efforts to enforce the rule called forth is instructively
shown by the wondering contempt with which a writer,
strictly papalist in his tendencies, comments upon the indiscreet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
reformatory zeal of Meinhard, Archbishop of Trèves. Elevated to
this lofty dignity in 1128, he at once undertook to force his clergy
to obey the rule by the most stringent measures, and speedily became
so odious that he was obliged to leave his bishopric within the year;
and the chronicler who tells the story has only words of reprobation
for the unfortunate prelate.<a id="FNanchor_587_587" href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> Even as late as the end of the twelfth
century, a chronicler of the popes, writing in southern Germany,
calls Gregory VII. an enforcer of impossibilities—“præceptor impossibilium”—because
he had endeavored to make good the rule of
celibacy;<a id="FNanchor_588_588" href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">588</a> and a council of Ratisbon, in the thirteenth century, while
lamenting the fact that there were few priests who did not openly
keep their concubines and children in their houses, quotes the canon
of Hildebrand forbidding the laity to attend at the ministrations of
such persons, but without venturing to hint at its enforcement.<a id="FNanchor_589_589" href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">589</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hungary had been Christianized at a time when the obligation of
celibacy was but lightly regarded, though it had not as yet become
obsolete. In reducing the dreaded and barbarous Majjars to civilization,
the managers of the movement might well smooth the path
and interpose as few obstacles as possible to the attainment of so
desirable a consummation. It is probable, therefore, that restrictions
on marriage, as applied to the priesthood, were lightly passed over,
and, not being insisted on, were disregarded by all parties. Even
the decretals of Nicholas II. and the fulminations of Gregory VII.
appear to have never penetrated into the kingdom of St. Stephen,
for sacerdotal celibacy seems to have been unknown among the
Hungarians until the close of the century. The first allusion to it
occurs in the synod of Zabolcs, held in 1092, under the auspices of
St. Ladislas II., and is of a nature to show not only that it was an
innovation on established usages, but also that the subject required
tender handling to reconcile it to the weakness of undisciplined
human nature. After the bitter denunciations and cruelly harsh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
measures which the popes had been promulgating for nearly half a
century, there is an impressive contrast in the mildness with which
the Hungarian church offered indulgence to those legitimately united
to a first wife, until the Holy See could be consulted for a definitive
decision;<a id="FNanchor_590_590" href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">590</a> and though marriages with second wives, widows, or
divorced women were pronounced null and void, the disposition to
evade a direct meeting of the question is manifested in a regulation
which provided that if a priest united himself to his female slave
“uxoris in locum,” the woman should be sold; but if he refused to
part with her, he was simply to pay her price to the bishop.<a id="FNanchor_591_591" href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">591</a>
Whether or not the pope’s decision was actually sought, we have no
means of knowing; if it was, his inevitable verdict received little
respect, for the Synod of Gran, held about the year 1099 by the
Primate Seraphin of Gran, only ventured to recommend moderation
to married priests, while its endeavor to enforce the rule prohibiting
marriage after the assumption of orders shows how utterly the recognized
discipline of the church was neglected. The consent of wives
was also required before married priests could be elevated to the
episcopate, and after consecration separation was strictly enjoined,
affording still further evidence of the laxity allowed to the other
grades. The iteration of the rules respecting <i>digami</i> and marriage
with widows also indicates how difficult was the effort to resuscitate
those well-known regulations, although they were universally admitted
to be binding on all ecclesiastics.<a id="FNanchor_592_592" href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">592</a></p>

<p>King Coloman, whose reign extended from 1095 to 1114, has the
credit of being the first who definitely enjoined immaculate purity
on the Hungarian priesthood. His laws, as collected by Alberic,
have no dates, and therefore we are unable to affix precise epochs to
them; but his legislation on the subject appears to have been progressive,
for we find edicts containing injunctions respecting <i>digami</i>
and irregular unions in terms which indicate that single marriages
were not interfered with; and these may reasonably be deemed earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
than other laws which formally prohibit the elevation to the diaconate
of an unmarried man without exacting from him a vow of continence,
or of a married man without the consent of his wife. The import of
this latter condition is explained by another law, which provided that
no married man should officiate at the altar unless his wife professed
continence, and was furnished by her husband with the means of
dwelling apart from him.<a id="FNanchor_593_593" href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">593</a> As these stringent regulations form part
of the canons of a council held by Archbishop Seraphin about the
year 1109,<a id="FNanchor_594_594" href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">594</a> they were probably borrowed from that council by Coloman,
and incorporated into his laws at a period somewhat later.</p>

<p>I have not met with any indications of the results of the legislation
which thus combined the influence of the temporal and ecclesiastical
authorities. That it effected little, however, is apparent from the
evidence afforded by Dalmatia, at that time a province of Hungary.
Shortly before it lost its independence, its duke, Dimitri, resolved to
assume the crown of royalty, and purchased the assent of Gregory
VII. at the price of acknowledging him as feudal superior. Gregory
took advantage of Dimitri’s aspirations to further the plans of reform,
of which he never lost sight; for, in the coronation oath taken in
1076 before Gebizo, the papal legate, the new king swore that he
would take such measures as would insure the chastity of all ecclesiastics,
from the bishop to the subdeacon.<a id="FNanchor_595_595" href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> The new dynasty did not
last long, for before the end of the century St. Ladislas united the
province of Dalmatia to the kingdom of Hungary; but neither the
oath of Dimitri, the laws of Coloman, nor the canons of the national
councils succeeded in eradicating the custom of priestly marriage.
When we find, in 1185, Urban III. in approving the acts of the
synod of Spalatro, graciously expressing his approbation of its prohibiting
the marriage of priests, and desiring that the injunction
should be extended so as to include the diaconate,<a id="FNanchor_596_596" href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">596</a> we see that marriage
must have been openly enjoyed by all ranks, that the synod
had not ventured to include in the restriction any but the highest
order, and that Urban himself did not undertake to apply the rule to
subdeacons, although they had been specially included in Dimitri’s
oath. Yet still pope and synod labored in vain, for fourteen years
later, in 1199, another national council complained that priests kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
both wives and benefices. It therefore commanded that those who
indulged in this species of adultery should either dismiss their partners
in guilt, and undergo due penance, or else should give up their
churches; while no married man should be admitted to the diaconate,
unless his wife would take a vow of continence before the bishop.<a id="FNanchor_597_597" href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">597</a>
Even yet, however, the subdiaconate is not alluded to, although the
legates who presided over the council were those of Innocent III.</p>

<p>Of how little avail were these efforts is shown by the national
council held at Vienna as late as 1267, by Cardinal Guido, legate of
Clement IV. It was still found necessary to order the deprivation
of priests and deacons who persisted in retaining their wives; while
the special clauses respecting those who married after taking orders
prove that such unions were frequent enough to require tender consideration
in removing the evil. The subdiaconate, also, was declared
liable to the same regulations, but the resistance of the members of
that order was probably stubborn, for the canons were suspended in
their favor until further instructions should be received from the
pope.<a id="FNanchor_598_598" href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">598</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Poland was equally remiss in enforcing the canons on her clergy.
The leaning of the Slavonic races towards the Greek church rendered
them, in fact, peculiarly intractable, and marriage was commonly
practised by the clergy at least until the close of the twelfth
century.<a id="FNanchor_599_599" href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">599</a> At length the efforts of Rome were extended to that
distant region, and in 1197 the papal legate, Cardinal Peter of Capua,
held the synod of Lanciski, when the priests were peremptorily
ordered to dismiss their wives and concubines, who, in the words of
the historian, were at that time universally and openly kept.<a id="FNanchor_600_600" href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">600</a> The
result of this seems to have amounted to little, for in 1207 we find
Innocent III. sharply reproving the bishops of the province of
Gnesen because married men were publicly admitted to ecclesiastical
dignities, and canons took no shame in the families growing
up around them. The children of priests were brought up to the
sacred profession of their fathers, assisted them in their ministrations,
and succeeded to their benefices. Whether or not the other disorders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
which Innocent designated as infecting the churches were the result
of the carnal affections which thus superseded the spiritual we may
fairly doubt, in view of the abuses still prevailing in more favored
regions.<a id="FNanchor_601_601" href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">601</a> The effort was continued, and was apparently at length
successful, at least in the western portions of the Polish church, for
at the council of Breslau, held in 1279, there is no mention of
wives, and the constitution of Guido, legate of Clement IV., is
quoted, depriving of benefices those who openly kept concubines.<a id="FNanchor_602_602" href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">602</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The church of Sweden was no purer than its neighbors. That
the rule was recognized there at a tolerably early period is shown by
the fact that when the people of Scania, about the year 1180, revolted
against the exactions of Waldemar I. of Denmark, they demanded to
be released from the oppression of tithes and that the clergy should
be married. Singularly enough, the clerks stood by their bishop,
Absalom, when he laid an interdict on the province, and the arms of
Waldemar speedily subdued the revolt.<a id="FNanchor_603_603" href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">603</a> Not much, however, was
gained for church discipline by this. In 1204, the Archbishop of
Lunden reported to Innocent III. that he had used every endeavor
to enforce the canons and had brought many of his priests to observe
chastity, but that there still were many who persisted in retaining
their women, whom they treated as though they were legitimate
wives, with fidelity and conjugal affection. To this Innocent replied
that the recalcitrants must be coerced by suspension, and, if necessary,
by deprivation of benefice.<a id="FNanchor_604_604" href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> How little result this achieved is evident
when we find the archbishop again writing to Innocent III. complaining
that the Swedish priests persisted in living with their wives,
and that they moreover claimed to have a papal dispensation permitting
it. Innocent, in reply, cautiously abstained from pronouncing
an opinion as to the validity of these pretensions until he should have
an opportunity of examining the document to which they appealed.<a id="FNanchor_605_605" href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">605</a>
The efforts at this time were fruitless, for, in 1248, we find the
Cardinal of St. Sabina as legate of Innocent IV. holding a council
at Schening, of which the principal object was to reform these abuses,
and so firmly were they established, that the Swedes were considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
as schismatics of the Greek church, in consequence of the marriage
of their priests. The council supported by the royal power, succeeded
in forcing the Swedish ecclesiastics to give up their wives, by a liberal
use of all the punishments then in vogue, together with the significant
threat of abandoning them to the tender mercies of the secular
tribunals.<a id="FNanchor_606_606" href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">606</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Denmark and along the northern coasts of Germany, there was
equal delay in enforcing the canon of celibacy. It is suggestive of
some powerful intercession in favor of the married clergy when we
see Paschal II., in 1117, writing to the King of Denmark that the
rule was imperative, and that he could admit of no exceptions to it.<a id="FNanchor_607_607" href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">607</a>
His insistence, however, was of little avail. In 1266, Cardinal
Guido, legate of Clement IV., held a council at Bremen, where he
was obliged to take rigorous measures to put an end to this Nicolitan
heresy. All married priests, deacons, and subdeacons were pronounced
incapable of holding any ecclesiastical office whatever.
Children born of such unions were declared infamous, and incapable
of inheritance, and any property received by gift or otherwise from
their fathers was confiscated. Those who permitted their daughters,
sisters, or other female relatives to contract such marriages, or gave
them up in concubinage to priests, were excluded from the church.
That a previous struggle had taken place on the subject is evident
from the penalties threatened against the prelates who were in the
habit of deriving a revenue from the protection of these irregularities,
and from an allusion to the armed resistance, made by the married
and concubinary priests with their friends, to all efforts to check
their scandalous conduct.<a id="FNanchor_608_608" href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">608</a></p>

<p>In Friesland, too, the efforts of the sacerdotalists were long set at
naught. In 1219 Emo, Abbot of Wittewerum, describing the disastrous
inundations which afflicted his country, considers them as a
punishment sent to chastise the vices of the land, and among the
disorders which were peculiarly obnoxious to the wrath of God he
enumerates the public marriage of the priests, the hereditary transmission
of benefices, and the testamentary provision made by ecclesi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>astics
for their children out of the property which should accrue to
the church; while his references to the canon law inhibiting these
practices, show that these transgressions were not excusable through
ignorance.<a id="FNanchor_609_609" href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">609</a> The warning was unheeded, for Abbot Emo alludes
incidentally, on various subsequent occasions, to the hereditary transmission
of several deaneries as a matter of course.<a id="FNanchor_610_610" href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">610</a> The deans in
Friesland were ecclesiastics of high position, each having six or more
parishes under his jurisdiction, which he governed under legatine
power from the Bishop of Munster. When, in 1271, the people rose
against them, exasperated by their intolerable exactions, in some
temporary truce the deans gave their <i>children</i> as hostages; and
when, after their expulsion, Gerard of Munster came to their assistance
by excommunicating the rebels, the latter defended the movement
by the argument that the deans had violated the laws of the
church by handing down their positions from father to son, and that
each generation imitated the incontinence of its predecessor.<a id="FNanchor_611_611" href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">611</a> Hildebrand
might have applauded this reasoning, but his days were past.
The church by this time had gained the position to which it had
aspired, and no longer invoked secular assistance to enforce its laws.
Even Abbot Menco, while admitting the validity of the popular
argument, claimed that such questions were reserved for the decision
of the church alone, and that the people must not interfere.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After thus marking the slow progress of the Hildebrandine movement
in these frontier lands of Christendom, let us see what efforts
were required to establish the reform in regions less remote.</p>

FRANCE.</h2>


<p>Gregory VII. had not been so engrossed in his quarrels with the
Empire as to neglect the prosecution of his favorite schemes of reform
elsewhere. If he displayed somewhat less of energy and zeal in
dealing with the ecclesiastical foibles of other countries, it was perhaps
because the political complications which gave a special zest to
his efforts in Germany were wanting, and because there was no
organized resistance supported by the temporal authorities. Yet the
inertia of passive non-compliance long rendered his endeavors and
those of his successors equally nugatory.</p>

<p>As early as 1056 we find Victor II., by means of his vicars at the
council of Toulouse, enjoining on the priesthood separation from their
wives, under penalty of excommunication and deprivation of function
and benefice.<a id="FNanchor_612_612" href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">612</a> This was followed up in 1060 by Nicholas II., who
sought through his envoys to enforce the observance of his decretals
on celibacy in France, and under the presidency of his legate the
council of Tours in that year adopted a canon of the most decided
character. All who, since the promulgation of the decretal of 1060,
had continued in the performance of their sacred functions while still
preserving relations with their wives and concubines were deprived
of their grades without hope of restoration; and the same irrevocable
penalty was denounced against those who in the future should
endeavor to combine the incompatible duties of husband and minister
of Christ.<a id="FNanchor_613_613" href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">613</a></p>

<p>In what spirit these threats and injunctions were likely to be
received may be gathered from an incident which occurred, probably
about this time. A French bishop, as in duty bound, excommunicated
one of his deacons for marrying. The clergy of the diocese,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
keen to appreciate the prospect of future trouble, rallied around their
persecuted brother, and rose in open rebellion against the prelate.
The latter, apparently, was unable to maintain his position, and the
matter was referred for adjudication to the celebrated Berenger of
Tours. Although, in view of the papal jurisprudence of the period,
the bishop would seem to have acted with leniency, yet Berenger
blamed both parties for their precipitancy and quarrelsome humor,
and decided that the excommunication of a deacon for marrying was
contrary to the canons, unless rendered unavoidable by the contumacy
of the offender.<a id="FNanchor_614_614" href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">614</a></p>

<p>Even more significant was the scene which occurred in 1074 in
the council of Paris, where the holy St. Gauthier, Abbot of Ponthoise,
undertook to sustain the decretal by which Gregory VII.
prohibited attendance on the masses of married and concubinary
priests. The assembly manifested its disapprobation of the measure
in a manner so energetic that its unlucky advocate, after being furiously
berated and soundly pummelled, was glad to escape with his
life from the hands of his indignant brethren.<a id="FNanchor_615_615" href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">615</a></p>

<p>When such was the spirit of the ecclesiastical body, there was
little to be expected from any internal attempt at reform. At the
stormy synod of Poitiers, in 1078, the papal legate, Hugh, Bishop
of Die, succeeded in obtaining the adoption of a canon which threatened
with excommunication all who should knowingly listen to the
mass of a concubinary or simoniacal priest,<a id="FNanchor_616_616" href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">616</a> but this seems to have
met with little response. Coercion from without was evidently requisite,
and in this case, as we have seen, Gregory did not shrink from
subjecting the church to the temporal power. In Normandy, for
instance, a synod held at Lisieux in 1055 had commanded the degradation
of priests who resided with wives or concubines. This was,
of course, ineffective, and in 1072 John, Archbishop of Rouen, held
a council in his cathedral city, where he renewed that canon in terms
which show how completely all orders and dignitaries were habitually
liable to its penalties.<a id="FNanchor_617_617" href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> The Norman clergy were not disposed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
submit quietly to this abridgement of their accustomed privileges,
and they expressed their dissent by raising a terrible clamor and
driving their archbishop from the council with a shower of stones,
from which he barely escaped alive.<a id="FNanchor_618_618" href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">618</a> At length, in view of the utter
failure of all ecclesiastical legislation, the laity were called in. William
the Conqueror, therefore, in 1080, assisted the Archbishop of
Rouen in holding a synod at Lillebonne, where the stern presence
of the suzerain prevented any unseemly resistance to the adoption
of most unpalatable regulations. All who were in holy orders were
forbidden, under any pretext, to keep women in their houses, and if,
when accused of disobedience, they were unable to prove themselves
innocent, their benefices were irretrievably forfeited. If the accusation
was made by the ecclesiastical officials, the offender was to be
tried by the episcopal court, but if his parishioners or feudal superior
were the complainants, he was to be brought before a mixed tribunal,
composed of the squires of his parish and the officials of the bishop.
This startling invasion of the dearest privileges of the church was
declared by William to proceed from no desire to interfere with the
jurisdiction of his bishops, but to be a temporary expedient, rendered
necessary by their negligence. Nor was this remarkable measure
the only thing that renders the synod of Lillebonne worthy of note,
for it affords us the earliest authoritative indication of a practice
which subsequently became a standing disgrace to the church. The
fifth canon declares that no priest shall be forced to give anything to
the bishop or to the officers of the diocese beyond their lawful dues,
and especially that no money shall be exacted on account of women
kept by clerks.<a id="FNanchor_619_619" href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> A tribute known as “cullagium” became at times
a recognized source of revenue, in consideration of which the weaknesses
of human nature were excused, and ecclesiastics were allowed
to enjoy in security the society of their concubines. We shall see
hereafter that this infamous custom continued to flourish until the
sixteenth century, despite the most strenuous and repeated endeavors
to remove so grievous a scandal.</p>

<p>It is probable that the expedient of mixed courts for the trial of
married and concubinary priests was not adopted without the concurrence
of Gregory, who was willing to make almost any sacrifice
necessary to accomplish his purpose. That they were organized and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
performed the functions delegated to them is shown by a reference
in a charter of 1088 to one held at Caumont, which required a priest
to abandon either his wife or his church.<a id="FNanchor_620_620" href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">620</a> So far, indeed, was Gregory
from protesting against this violation of ecclesiastical immunities,
that he was willing even to connive at the abuses which immediately
crept into the system, and to purchase the assistance of the laity by
allowing them to lay sacrilegious hands on the temporalities of the
church. Many of the nobles who thus assisted in expelling the
offending clergy seized the tithes and retained them. The papal
legate, Hugh, Bishop of Die—better known by his subsequent primatial
dignity of Lyons—proceeded against these invaders of church
property in the usual manner, and excommunicated them as a matter
of course. Gregory, however, who under ordinary circumstances
would have promptly consigned the spoilers to the bottomless pit,
now virtually took their side. He discreetly declined to confirm the
excommunication, reproved his legate for superserviceable zeal, and
ordered him in future to be more guarded and temperate in his proceedings.<a id="FNanchor_621_621" href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">621</a></p>

<p>Church and state—the zeal of the ecclesiastic and the avarice of
the noble—vainly united to break down the stubbornness of the
Norman priesthood, for marriage continued to be enjoyed as openly
as ever. The only effect of the attempted reform, indeed, appeared
to be that when a priest entered into matrimony he took a solemn
vow never to give up his wife, a measure prompted doubtless by the
fears of the bride and her kindred. The nuptials were public; male
issue succeeded to benefices by a recognized primogeniture, and female
children received their fathers’ churches as dower, when other resources
were wanting. About the beginning of the twelfth century,
three enthusiastic ascetic reformers, the celebrated Robert d’Arbrissel,
founder of Fontevrault, Bernard Abbot of Tiron, and Vitalis of
Mortain traversed Normandy and preached with great earnestness
against these abuses, the result of which was that they nearly came
to an untimely end at the hands of the indignant pastors and their
more indignant spouses. On one occasion, when Bernard was preaching
at Coutances, a married archdeacon assailed him, with a crowd
of priests and clerks, asking how he, a monk, dead to the world,
presumed to preach to the living. Bernard replied that Samson had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
slain his foes with the jaw-bone of a dead ass, and then proceeded
with so moving a discourse on Samson, that the archdeacon was
converted, and interfered to save him from the mob.<a id="FNanchor_622_622" href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">622</a></p>

<p>If William the Conqueror found his advantage in thus assisting
the hopeless reform within his duchy of Normandy, he had no hesitation
in obstructing it when his policy demanded such a course in
his subject province of Britanny. During the three and a half centuries
through which the Breton church maintained its independence
of the archiepiscopal see of Tours, its metropolis was Dol. Judhaël,
who occupied its lofty seat, not only obtained it by simony, but sullied
it by a public marriage; and when the offspring of this illicit union
reached maturity he portioned them from the property of the
church. This prolonged violation of the canons attracted the attention
of Gregory soon after his accession, and in 1076 he informed
William that he had deposed the offender. William, however, saw
fit to defend the scandal, and refused to receive Evenus, Abbot of St.
Melanius, whom Gregory had appointed as a successor.<a id="FNanchor_623_623" href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">623</a> Judhaël,
indeed, was no worse than his suffragans. For three generations the
diocese of Quimper was held by father, son, and grandson; while
the Bishops of Rennes, Vannes, and Nantes were openly married,
and their wives enjoyed the recognized rank of countesses, as an
established right.<a id="FNanchor_624_624" href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">624</a> How much improvement resulted from the efforts
of Gregory and his legate Hugh may be estimated from the description,
in general terms, of the iniquities ascribed to the Breton clergy,
both secular and regular, in the early part of the next century, by
Paschal II. when granting the pallium to Baldric, Archbishop of
Dol. All classes are described as indulging in enormities hateful to
God and man, and as having no hesitation in setting the canons at
defiance. In Britanny, as in Wales and Spain, the centralizing
influence of Rome was at fault, and priestly marriage was persevered
in long after it had been abrogated elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_625_625" href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">625</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Flanders, Count Robert the Frisian and Adela, his mother, were
well disposed to second the reformatory measures of Gregory, but,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
doubting their right to eject the offenders, they applied to him, in
1076, for instructions. His answers were unequivocal, urging them
to the most prompt and summary proceedings.<a id="FNanchor_626_626" href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">626</a> The spirit in which
the clergy met the attack was manifested by the incident already
described, when, in 1077, an unfortunate zealot was burned at the
stake in Cambrai for maintaining the propriety of the papal decretals.
The same disposition, though fortunately leading to less deplorable
results, was exhibited in Artois. At the instance of Adela, Robert,
in 1072, had founded the Priory of Watten, near St. Omer. Despite
this powerful interest and patronage, the house had a severe struggle
for existence, as its prior, Otfrid, lent his influence to support the
reform and to enforce the decrees of Gregory. Reproaches and
curses were showered upon the infant community, and it was openly
threatened with fire and sword, until the unfortunate brethren felt
equally insecure within their walls and abroad. At length the
Countess Adela took Otfrid with her on a pilgrimage to Rome, and
there the holy man procured from Gregory a confirmation of the
privileges of his house. On his return, he found that this instrument
only made the persecution more vehement. Accusations of all kinds
were made against the priory, and its enemies succeeded in causing
the brethren to be brought for trial before the local synod, where the
production of the papal charter was ordered. It was at once pronounced
a forgery, was taken away by force, and was retained by the
Bishop, Drogo of Terouane, in spite of all remonstrance.<a id="FNanchor_627_627" href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">627</a></p>

<p>The opposition of the clergy was not lessened by the manner in
which the secular authorities exercised the power bestowed upon
them. Count Robert saw the advantages derivable from the position
of affairs and seems to have been resolved to turn it thoroughly to
account. Among other modes adopted was that of the “jus spolii,”
by which he seized the effects of dying ecclesiastics, turning their
families out of doors and disinheriting the heirs. These arbitrary
proceedings he defended on the ground of the incontinence of the
sufferers, boldly declaring that wicked priests were no priests—as if,
groaned the indignant clerks, sinful men were not men.<a id="FNanchor_628_628" href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">628</a> In 1091,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
the Flemish priests complained of these acts to Urban II., and he
vainly endeavored to interfere in their behalf.<a id="FNanchor_629_629" href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">629</a> Finding this resource
fail, they appealed to their metropolitan, Renaud, Archbishop of
Rheims, who by active measures succeeded in putting an end to the
abuse in 1092.</p>

<p>Amid all this the church proved powerless to enforce its laws, and
again it called upon the feudal authority for assistance—this time in
a manner by which it admitted its impotence on a question so vital.
In 1099, Manasses of Rheims held a provincial synod at St. Omer,
which instructed the Count of Flanders, Robert the Hierosolymitan,
to seize the wives of all priests who after excommunication declined
to abandon their guilty partners; and in this he was not to ask or
wait for the assent of the bishop of the diocese. The sturdy Crusader
would doubtless have carried out this order to the letter, with
all its attendant cruelty and misery, but the clergy of the province
united in remonstrances so vehement that Manasses was forced to
abandon his position. He accordingly requested Robert on no
account to disturb the married priests and their wives, or to permit
his nobles to do so, except when assistance was demanded by the
bishops. He acknowledged the injustice he had committed in overslaughing
the constituted authorities of the church, and deprecated
the rapine and spoliation which so ill-advised a proceeding might
cause. At the same time he admonished his suffragans to proceed
vigorously against all who married in orders, and to call on the
seigneurial power to coerce those who should prove contumacious.<a id="FNanchor_630_630" href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">630</a></p>

<p>Harsh and violent as were the measures thus threatened, there
appears to have been extreme hesitation in carrying them out. A
certain clerk known as Robert of Artois committed the unpardonable
indiscretion of marrying a widow, and openly resisted all the efforts
of his bishop to reduce him to obedience. Not only his original
crime, but his subsequent contumacious rebellion would assuredly
justify the severest chastisement, yet both the secular and ecclesiastical
powers of the province seem to have been at fault, for it was
found necessary to ask the interference of no less a personage than
Richard, Bishop of Albano, then enjoying the dignity of papal legate
in France. In 1104 the legate accordingly addressed the Count of
Flanders with the very moderate request that the obstinate rebel and
his abettors should be held as excommunicate until they should rec<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>oncile
themselves to their bishop. Robert finally appealed to Rome
itself, but in the end was obliged to succumb. Similar was the case
of two Artesian deacons who refused to abandon their wives until
Lambert, the bishop of Artois, excommunicated them, when they
travelled to Rome in hopes of reconciliation to the church. Paschal
II. absolved them on their taking a solemn oath upon the Gospels
to live chastely in future, and he sent them back to Lambert with
instructions to keep a careful watch upon them.<a id="FNanchor_631_631" href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">631</a> These cases, which
chance to remain on record, show how obstinately the clergy held
to their wives and how difficult it was to convince them that the
authorities of the church were determined to enforce the canons.
We therefore need not be surprised to find Paschal II., after the year
1100, writing to the clergy of Terouane, expressing his astonishment
that, in spite of so many decretals of popes and canons of councils,
they still adhered to their consorts, some of them openly and some
secretly. To remedy this, he has nothing but a repetition of the
old threat of deprivation.<a id="FNanchor_632_632" href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">632</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The confusion which this attempted reformation caused in France
was apparently not so aggravated as we have seen it in Germany,
and yet it was sufficiently serious. Guibert de Nogent relates that
in his youth commenced the persecution of the married priests by
Rome, when a cousin of his, a layman of flagrant and excessive
licentiousness, made himself conspicuous by his attacks on the failings
of the clergy. The family were anxious to provide for young
Guibert, who was destined to the church, and the cousin used his
influence with the patron of a benefice to oust the married incumbent
and bestow the preferment on Guibert. The priest thus forcibly
ejected abandoned neither his wife nor his functions, but relieved his
mind by excommunicating every day, in the Mass, Guibert’s mother
and all her family, until the good woman’s fears were so excited that
she abandoned the prebend which she had obtained with so much
labor.<a id="FNanchor_633_633" href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">633</a> We can readily conceive this incident to be a type of what
was occurring in every corner of the kingdom, when, in an age of
brute force, the reverence which was the only defence of the priesthood
was partially destroyed, and the people hardly knew whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
they were to adore their pastors as representatives of God or to
dread them as the powerful ministers of evil.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the religious ardor of Europe rose to the wild excitement
that culminated in the Crusades, and Pope Urban II. astutely
availed himself of the movement to place the church in possession
of a stronger influence over the minds of men than it had ever
before enjoyed, it was to no purpose that the great council of Clermont,
in 1095, took the opportunity to proclaim in the most solemn
manner the necessity of perfect purity in ministers of the altar, to
denounce irrevocable expulsion for contravention of the rule, and to
forbid the children of ecclesiastics from entering the church except
as monks or canons.<a id="FNanchor_634_634" href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">634</a> It was the weightiest exposition of church
discipline, and was promulgated under circumstances to give it the
widest publicity and the highest authority. Yet, within a few years,
we find Gualo, Bishop of Paris, applying to Ivo of Chartres for
advice as to what ought to be done with a canon of his church who
had recently married, and Ivo in reply recommending as a safe
course that the marriage be held valid, but that the offender be
relieved of his stipend and functions.<a id="FNanchor_635_635" href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">635</a> His answer, moreover, is
written in a singularly undecided tone, and an elaborate argument
is presented as though the matter were still open to discussion,
although Ivo’s laborious compilations of the canon law show that
he was thoroughly familiar with the ancient discipline which the
depravity of his generation had rendered obsolete.<a id="FNanchor_636_636" href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">636</a> Hardly less
significant is another epistle in which Ivo calls the attention of
Daimbert, Archbishop of Sens, to the conduct of one of his dignitaries
who publicly maintained two concubines and was preparing to
marry a third. He urges Daimbert to put an end to the scandal,
and suggests that if he is unable to accomplish it single-handed, he
should summon two or three of his suffragans to his assistance.<a id="FNanchor_637_637" href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">637</a>
Either of these instances is a sufficient confession of the utter futility
of the ceaseless exertions which for half a century the church had
been making to enforce her discipline. Nor, perhaps, can her ill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>-success
be wondered at when we consider how unworthy were the
hands to which was frequently intrusted the administering of the
law and the laxity of opinion which viewed the worst transgressions
with indulgence. The archdeacons were the officials to whom was
specially confided the supervision over sacerdotal morals, and yet,
when a man occupying that responsible position, like Aldebert of
Le Mans, publicly surrounded himself with a harem, and took no
shame from the resulting crowd of offspring, so little did his conduct
shock the sensibilities of the age that he was elevated to the episcopal
chair, and only the stern voice of Ivo could be heard reproving the
measureless scandal.<a id="FNanchor_638_638" href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">638</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Equal looseness pervaded the monastic establishments. Hildebert,
Bishop of Le Mans, made numerous fruitless attempts to restore
discipline in the celebrated abbey of Euron, the monks of which
indulged in the grossest licentiousness, and successfully defied his
power until he was obliged to appeal to the papal legate for assistance.<a id="FNanchor_639_639" href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">639</a>
Albero of Verdun, after fruitless attempts to reform the
monastery of St. Paul, in his episcopal city, was obliged to turn out
the monks by force and replace them with Premonstratensians, who
were then in the full ardor of their new discipline.<a id="FNanchor_640_640" href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">640</a> The description
which Ivo of Chartres gives of the convent of St. Fara shows a promiscuous
and shameless prostitution, on the part of the nuns of that
institution, even more degrading.<a id="FNanchor_641_641" href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">641</a> Instances like these could be
almost indefinitely multiplied, such as that of St. Mary of Argentueil,
reformed by Heloise, the great foundation of St. Denis, previous
to the abbacy of Suger, and that of St. Gildas de Ruys in
Britanny, as described by Abelard;<a id="FNanchor_642_642" href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">642</a> who, moreover, depicts the
nuns of the period, in general terms, as abandoned to the most
hideous licentiousness—those who were good-looking prostituting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
themselves for hire, those who were not so fortunate hiring men to
gratify their passions, while the older ones, who had passed the age
of lust, acted as procuresses.<a id="FNanchor_643_643" href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">643</a> Innocent III. may therefore be
absolved from the charge of exaggeration when, in ordering the
reform of the nuns of St. Agatha, he alludes to their convent as a
brothel which infected with its evil reputation the whole country
around it.<a id="FNanchor_644_644" href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">644</a> A contemporary chronicler records as a matter of special
wonder that John of Salisbury, Bishop of Chartres, forced his canons
to live in cloisters according to the Rule of St. Augustin; and he
adds that, stimulated by this example, his uncle, John of Lisieux, and
his successor, Geoffrey of Chartres, attempted the same reform, but
without success.<a id="FNanchor_645_645" href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">645</a> It is true that some partial reform was effected by
St. Bernard, but the austerities of the new orders founded by enthusiasts
like him and St. Bruno, Robert d’Arbrissel and St. Norbert,
did not cure the ineradicable vices of the older establishments.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With such examples before us, it is not difficult to believe the truth
of the denunciations with which the celebrated Raoul of Poitiers,
whose fiery zeal gained for him the distinctive appellation of Ardens,
lashed the vices of his fellows; nor can we conclude that it was mere
rhetorical amplification which led him to declare that the clergy, who
should be models for their flocks, were more shameless and abandoned
than those whose lives it was their duty to guide.<a id="FNanchor_646_646" href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">646</a> Peter
Cantor, indeed, deplores the superiority of the laity to the clergy
as the greatest injury that afflicted the church.<a id="FNanchor_647_647" href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">647</a></p>

<p>The natural result of such a state of morals was the prevalence of
the hereditary principle against which the church had so long and so
perseveringly striven. How completely this came to be regarded as
a matter of course, is shown by a contemporary charter to the ancient
monastery of Bèze, by which a priest named Germain, on entering it
bestowed upon it his holding, consisting of certain specified tithes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
This deed of gift is careful to declare the assent of the sons of the
donor, showing that the title of the monastery would not have been
considered good as against the claims of Germain’s descendants had
they not joined in the conveyance.<a id="FNanchor_648_648" href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">648</a> Even as late as 1202 we find
Innocent III. endeavoring to put a stop to the hereditary transmission
of benefices in the bishopric of Toul, where it was practised
to an extent which showed how little impression had as yet been
made by the unceasing efforts of the last hundred and fifty years.<a id="FNanchor_649_649" href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">649</a></p>

<p>When in the presence of so stiff-necked and evil disposed a generation,
all human efforts seemed unavailing to secure respect for the
canons of councils and decretals of popes, we need scarcely wonder if
recourse was had to the miraculous agencies which so often proved
efficacious in subduing the minds of men. Wondrous stories, accordingly,
were not wanting, to show how offended Heaven sometimes
gave in this world a foretaste of the wrath to come, awaiting those
who lived in habitual disregard of the teachings of the church. Thus
Peter the Venerable relates with much unction how a priest, who
had abandoned himself to carnal indulgences, died amid the horrors
of anticipated hell-fire. Visible to him alone, the demons chuckling
around his death-bed heated the frying-pan of burning fat in which
he was incontinently to be plunged, while a drop flying from the
sputtering mass seared him to the bone, as a dreadful material sign
that his agony was not the distempered imagining of a tortured
conscience. A miracle equally significant wrung a confession of his
weakness from the Dean of Minden in 1167.<a id="FNanchor_650_650" href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">650</a></p>

<p>If Heaven thus miraculously manifested its anger, it was equally
ready to welcome back the repentant sinner. In the first energy of
the reforms of St. Bernard, a priest entered the abbey of Clairvaux.
The rigor of the Cistercian discipline wore out his enthusiasm; he
fled from the convent, returned to his parish, and, according to the
general custom, (“sicut multis consuetudinis est”) took to himself a
concubine, and soon saw a family increasing around him. The holy
St. Bernard chanced to pass that way and accepted the priest’s warm
hospitality without recognizing him. When the Saint was ready to
depart in the morning he found that his host was absent performing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
his functions in the church, and, turning to one of the children, he
sent him with a message to his father. Though the child had been
a deaf-mute from birth, he promptly performed the errand. Roused
by the miracle to a sense of his iniquity, the apostate rushed to the
Saint, threw himself at his feet, confessed who he was, and entreated
to be taken back to the monastery. St. Bernard touched by his
repentance, promised to call for him on his return. To this the
priest objected, on the ground that he might die during the interval,
but was comforted with the assurance that if he died in such a frame
of mind, he would be received by God as a monk. When St. Bernard
returned, the repentant sinner was dead. Inquiring as to the ceremonies
of his interment, he was told that the corpse had been buried
in its priestly garments; whereupon he ordered the grave to be
opened, and it was found arrayed, not in its funeral robes, but in full
Cistercian habit and tonsure, showing that God had fulfilled the
promises made in his name.<a id="FNanchor_651_651" href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">651</a></p>

<p>Such was the condition of the Gallican church when, in 1119,
Calixtus II. stepped from the archiepiscopal see of Vienne to the
chair of St. Peter. His first great object was to end the quarrel
with the empire on the subject of investitures, the vicissitudes of
which rendered the papacy at the time of his accession an exile from
Italy; his second was to carry out the reforms so long and so fruitlessly
urged by his predecessors. To accomplish both these results
he lost no time in summoning a great council to assemble at Rheims,
and when it met in November, 1119, no less than fifteen archbishops,
more than two hundred bishops, and numerous abbots responded to
the call, representing Italy, France, Aquitaine, Spain, Germany, and
England. The attempted reconciliation with the Emperor Henry V.
failed, but the vices and corruptions of the church were vigorously
attacked and sternly prohibited for the future. All commerce with
concubines or wives was positively forbidden under pain of deprivation
of benefice and function. No choice was granted the offender,
for continuance in his sin after expulsion was punishable with excommunication;
and the hereditary transmission of ecclesiastical dignities
and property was strictly prohibited.<a id="FNanchor_652_652" href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">652</a> Whether it was the lofty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
character of the new pope, his royal blood and French extraction, or
whether the solemnity of the occasion impressed men’s minds, it is
not easy now to guess, but unquestionably these proceedings produced
greater effect upon the Transalpine churches than any previous
efforts of the Holy See. Calixtus was long regarded as the real
author of sacerdotal celibacy in France, and his memory has been
embalmed in the jingling verses which express the dissatisfaction and
spite of the clergy, deprived of their ancestral privileges.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">O bone Calliste, nunc clerus odit te;</div>
  <div class="verse">Olim presbyteri poterant uxoribus uti;</div>
  <div class="verse">Hoc detruxisti quando tu papa fuisti,</div>
  <div class="verse">Ergo tuum festum nunquam celebratur honestum.<a id="FNanchor_653_653" href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">653</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Calixtus was not a man to rest half way, nor was he content with
an empty promise of obedience. Under the pressure of his influence,
the French prelates found themselves obliged to take measures for
the vigorous enforcement of the canons. What those measures were,
and the disposition with which they were received, may be understood
from the resultant proceedings in Normandy. Geoffrey,
Archbishop of Rouen, on leaving the council of Rheims, promptly
called a synod, which assembled ere the month was out. The canon
prohibiting female intercourse roused abhorrence and resistance
among his clergy, and they inveighed loudly against the innovation.
Geoffrey singled out one who rendered himself particularly prominent
in the tumult, and caused him to be seized and cast into prison;
then, leaving the church, he called in his guards, whom, with acute
anticipation of trouble, he had posted in readiness. The rude
soldiery fell upon the unarmed priests, some of whom promptly
escaped; the rest, grasping what weapons they could find, made a
gallant resistance, and succeeded in beating back the assailants. A
mob speedily collected, which took sides with the archbishop. Assisted
by this unexpected reinforcement, the guards again forced their way
into the church, where they beat and maltreated the unfortunate
clerks to their heart’s content; when, as the chronicler quaintly
observes, the synod broke up in confusion, and the members fled
without awaiting the archiepiscopal benediction.<a id="FNanchor_654_654" href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">654</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span></p>

<p>The immediate effect of the reformation thus inaugurated may
perhaps be judged with sufficient accuracy by the story of Abelard
and Heloise, which occurred about this period. That Abelard was a
canon when that immortal love arose, was not, in such a state of
morals, any impediment to the gratification of his passion, nor did it
diminish the satisfaction of the canon Fulbert at the marriage of his
niece, for such marriages, as yet, were valid by ecclesiastical law.
In her marvellous self-abnegation, however, Heloise recognized that
while the fact of his openly keeping a mistress, and acknowledging
Astrolabius as his illegitimate son, would be no bar to his preferment,
and would leave open to him a career equal to the wildest dreams of
his ambition, yet to admit that he had sanctified their love by
marriage, and had repaired, as far as possible, the wrong which he
had committed, would ruin his prospects forever. In a worldly point
of view it was better for him, as a churchman, to have the reputation
of shameless immorality than that of a loving and pious husband;
and this was so evidently a matter of course that she willingly sacrificed
everything, and practised every deceit, that he might be considered
a reckless libertine, who had refused her the only reparation
in his power. Such was the standard of morals created by the
church, and such were the conclusions inevitably drawn from them.</p>

<p>Nor were these conclusions erroneous, if we may judge by an
incident of the period. An archdeacon of Angoulême had committed
the unpardonable crime of seducing the abbess of a convent
in the district under his charge. When the results of the amour
could be no longer concealed, and the Count of Angoulême ventured
to remonstrate with Gérard, the bishop of the diocese, that worthy
prelate protected the offender by dismissing the charge with a filthy
jest. Yet so far was Gérard from forfeiting the respect of his contemporaries
by this laxity, that he was soon afterwards appointed
papal legate.<a id="FNanchor_655_655" href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">655</a> Somewhat similar is the conclusion to be drawn from
an occurrence about the same time in the diocese of Comminges,
where a deacon was entangled in a guilty connection and was summoned
with his paramour before the bishop, St. Bertrand. The
reproof of the holy man reduced the deacon to contrition, but the
woman was defiant. He escaped punishment, while she was seized
by demons and expired on the spot.<a id="FNanchor_656_656" href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">656</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span></p>

<p>Yet there are evidences that the efforts of Calixtus, and of the
fathers whose assembled authority was concentrated at Rheims, did
not by any means eradicate a custom which had now become
traditional. Soon afterwards King Louis-le-Gros, in granting a
charter to the church of St. Cornelius at Compiègne, felt it necessary
to accompany the privileges bestowed with a restriction, worded as
though it were a novelty, to the effect that those in holy orders connected
with the foundation should have no wives—a condition which
shows how little confidence existed in the mind of the sagacious
prince as to the efficacy of the canons so portentiously promulgated
by the rulers, and so energetically resisted by the ruled.<a id="FNanchor_657_657" href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">657</a> That he
was justified in this lack of confidence is evident when we see,
further on in the century, an epistle of Alexander III., undated,
but probably written about 1170, complaining of the canons of St.
Ursmar and Antoin who openly kept concubines in their houses,
while some of them did not hesitate to marry;<a id="FNanchor_658_658" href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">658</a> while as late as
1212 a council of Paris was obliged to adopt canons forbidding clerks
married in the lower orders to hold parishes while retaining their
wives, and suspending from benefice and functions all those who
marry while in holy orders.<a id="FNanchor_659_659" href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">659</a></p>

<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII">XVII.</a><br />

NORMAN ENGLAND.</h2>


<p>We have already seen what was the condition of the Anglo-Saxon
church when William the Manzer overran the island with his horde
of adventurers. Making all due allowance for the fact that our
authorities are mostly of the class whose inclination would lead them
to misrepresent the conquered and to exaggerate the improvement
attributable to the conquest, it cannot be doubted that the standard
of morality was extremely low, and that the clergy were scarcely
distinguishable from the laity in purity of life or devotion to their
sacred calling.</p>

<p>If the reformatory efforts of the popes had not penetrated into the
kingdom of Edward the Confessor, it was hardly to be expected that
they would excite attention amid the turmoil attendant upon the
settlement of the new order of political affairs and the division of
the spoils among the conquerors. Accordingly, even the vigilance
of Gregory VII. appears to have virtually overlooked the distant
land of Britain, conscious, no doubt, that his efforts would be vain,
even though the influence of Rome had been freely thrown upon the
side of the Norman invader, and had been of no little assistance to
him in his preparations for the desperate enterprise. In fact, though
William saw fit to aid in the suppression of matrimony among the
priests of his hereditary dominions, and had thereby earned the
grateful praises of Gregory himself,<a id="FNanchor_660_660" href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">660</a> he does not seem to have
regarded the morals of his new subjects as worthy of any special
attention. It is true that in his system of transferring all power
from the subject to the dominant race, when Saxon bishops were to
be ejected and their places filled with his own creatures, it was necessary
for him to effect his purpose in a canonical way, and to procure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
the degradation of his victims by the church itself, as it was impossible
for him to lay unhallowed hands upon their consecrated heads,
or to remove prelates from their sees on questions of mere political
expediency. To accomplish this, the scandals and irregularities of
their lives afforded the promptest and most effective excuse, and it
was freely used. The vigor with which these changes were carried
into effect is visible in the synods of Winchester and Windsor in
1070, where numerous bishops and abbots were deprived on various
pleas; and the character of the prelates removed may be assumed
from the description of the Bishop of Litchfield (Chester) by Lanfranc,
in a letter of the same year to Alexander II., where his public
maintenance of wife and children is alleged, in addition to other
crimes of which he was accused.<a id="FNanchor_661_661" href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">661</a> Though a puritan, like Lanfranc,
bred in the asceticism of the Abbey of Bec, might seek to enforce
the canons in an individual case, as when he orders Arfastus, Bishop
of Thetford, to degrade a deacon who refused to part with his wife,<a id="FNanchor_662_662" href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">662</a>
yet that no general effort was made to effect a reform in the ranks of
the clergy is evident from an epistle addressed in 1071 to William
by Alexander II., in which, while praising his zeal in suppressing
the heresy of simony, and exhorting him to fresh exertion in the
good work, no mention whatever is made of the kindred error of
Nicolitism, which is usually inseparable in the papal diatribes of the
period.<a id="FNanchor_663_663" href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">663</a> Equally conclusive is the fact that when, in 1075, Lanfranc
held a national council in London for the purpose of reforming the
English church, canons were passed to restrain simony, to prevent
incestuous marriages, and to effect other needful changes, but nothing
was said respecting sacerdotal marriage, at that time the principal
object of Gregory’s vigorous measures.<a id="FNanchor_664_664" href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">664</a></p>

<p>How thoroughly, indeed, clerical marriage and the hereditary
descent of benefices was received as legitimate by common consent
is manifested by a case quoted by Camden from the MS. records of
the Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul of Shrewsbury. Under the
Conqueror, Roger de Montgomery in founding that house bestowed
upon it the church of St. Gregory, subject to the life estate of the
canons then holding it, whose prebends as they died should fall within
the gift of the monks. The children of the canons, however, dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>puted
the gift, claimed that they had a right to their fathers’ holdings,
and actually gave rise to a great lawsuit to defend their
position.<a id="FNanchor_665_665" href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">665</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first steps to check the irregularities of the priesthood appear
to have been taken in 1076, at the council of Winchester, and the
extreme tenderness there displayed by Lanfranc for the weakness of
his flock shows how necessary was the utmost caution in treating a
question evidently new, and one which deprived the English clergy
of a privilege to which no taint of guilt had previously been attached.
We have seen by the instance related above that when Lanfranc
could act according to his own convictions, he was inclined to enforce
the absolute rule of celibacy, and we may therefore conclude that on
this occasion he was overruled by the convictions of his brother prelates
that it was impossible to obtain obedience. All that the council
would venture upon was a general declaration against the wives of
men in orders, and it permitted parish priests to retain their consorts,
contenting itself with forbidding future marriages, and enjoining
on the bishops that they should thereafter ordain no one in the
diaconate or priesthood without a pledge not to marry in future.<a id="FNanchor_666_666" href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">666</a></p>

<p>Such legislation could only be irritating and inconclusive. It
abandoned the principle for which Rome had been contending, and
thus its spirit of worldly temporizing deprived it of all respect and
influence. Obedience to it could be therefore invoked on no higher
ground than that of an arbitrary and unjustifiable command, and
accordingly it received so small a share of attention that when, some
twenty-six years later, the holy Anselm, at the great council of London
in 1102, endeavored to enforce the reform, the restrictions which
he ordered were exclaimed against as unheard of novelties, which,
being impossible to human nature, could only result in indiscriminate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
vice, bringing disgrace upon the church.<a id="FNanchor_667_667" href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">667</a> The tenor of the canons
of this council, indeed, proves that the previous injunctions had been
utterly disregarded. At the same time they manifest a much stronger
determination to eradicate the evil, though they are still far more
lenient than the contemporary Continental legislation. No archdeacon,
priest, or deacon could marry, nor, if married, could retain
his wife. If a subdeacon, after professing chastity, married, he was
to be subjected to the same regulation. No priest, as long as he was
involved in such unholy union, could celebrate mass; if he ventured
to do so, no one was to listen to him; and he was, moreover, to be
deprived of all legal privileges. A profession of chastity was to be
exacted at ordination to the subdiaconate and to the higher grades;
and, finally, the children of priests were forbidden to inherit their
father’s churches.<a id="FNanchor_668_668" href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">668</a></p>

<p>One symptom of weakness is observable in all this. The council
apparently did not venture to prescribe any ecclesiastical punishment
for the infraction of the rules thus laid down. If this arose from
timidity, St. Anselm did not share it, for, when he proceeded to put
the canons in practice, we find him threatening his contumacious
ecclesiastics with deprivation for persistence in their irregularities.
A letter of instruction from him to William, Archdeacon of Canterbury,
shows the earnestness with which he entered upon the reform,
and also affords an instructive insight into the difficulties of the
enterprise, and the misery which the forcible sundering of family
ties caused among those who had never doubted the legality and
propriety of their marriages. Some ecclesiastics of rank sent their
discarded wives to manors at a distance from their dwellings, and
these St. Anselm directs shall not be molested if they will promise
to hold no intercourse except in the presence of legitimate witnesses.
Some priests were afraid to proceed to extremities with their wives,
and for these weak brethren grace is accorded until the approaching
Lent, provided they do not attempt meanwhile to perform their
sacred functions, and can find substitutes of undoubted chastity to
minister in their places. The kindred of the unfortunate women
apparently endeavored to avert the blow by furious menaces against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
those who should render obedience, and these instigators of evil are
to be restrained by threats of excommunication.<a id="FNanchor_669_669" href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">669</a> Another letter to
the Bishop of Hereford, who had applied for instructions on the
subject, directs him to replace recalcitrant priests with monks and
to stir up the laity to drive from the land the obstinate parsons and
their wives.<a id="FNanchor_670_670" href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">670</a> In the enforcement of these reforms he seemed to
meet with questions for which he was not prepared, for about this
time we find him seeking instructions from Paschal II. on several
knotty points: whether a priest living with his wife can be allowed
to administer the viaticum at the death-bed in the absence of one
professing continence; and what is to be done with him if he refuses
his ministration on the ground that he is not allowed to celebrate
mass. Paschal replies, sensibly enough, that it is better to have the
ministrations of an unchaste priest than to die unhouselled, and that
a priest refusing his offices under such circumstances is to be punished
as a homicide of souls. This abandoned the Hildebrandine
theory and practice, and Anselm was more consistent when he
assumed that a layman could perform baptism in preference to an
unchaste priest.<a id="FNanchor_671_671" href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">671</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding these zealous efforts of the primate, and the
countenance of Henry Beauclerc, in whose presence the council had
been held, Eadmer is forced sorrowfully to admit that its canons
received but scant respect. Many of the priests adopted a kind of
passive resistance, and, locking up their churches, suspended the
performance of all sacred rites.<a id="FNanchor_672_672" href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">672</a> Even in Anselm’s own diocese,
ecclesiastics were found who obstinately refused either to part with
their wives or to pretermit their functions, and who, when duly
excommunicated, laughed at the sentence, and continued to pollute
the church with their unhallowed ministry.<a id="FNanchor_673_673" href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">673</a> Soon after this Anselm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
fell into disfavor with the king and was exiled. His absence promised
immunity, and the clergy were not slow to avail themselves of
it. In 1104 one of his friends, in writing to him, bewails the utter
demoralization of the kingdom, of which the worst manifestation was
that priests still continued to marry; and two years later another
letter informs him that those who had apparently reformed their evil
ways were all returning to their previous life of iniquity. Finally,
Henry I. resolved to turn to account this clerical backsliding, as a
financial expedient to recruit his exhausted treasury. All who were
suspected of disobedience to the canons of the council of London
were seized and tried, and the property of those who could be proved
guilty was confiscated. By this time Anselm had been reconciled
to the king, and he promptly interfered to check so gross a violation
of ecclesiastical immunity. His remonstrances were met by Henry
with well-feigned surprise, and finally the matter was compromised
by discharging those who had not been fined, while those who had
been forced to pay were promised three years’ undisturbed possession
of their positions.<a id="FNanchor_674_674" href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">674</a></p>

<p>That it was impossible to effect suddenly so great a change in the
habits and lives of the Anglican clergy was, indeed, admitted by
Paschal II. himself, when, in 1107, he wrote to Anselm concerning
the questions connected with the children of priests. While reminding
him of the rules of the church, he adds that as, in England, the
larger and better portion of the clergy fall within the scope of the
prohibition, he grants to the primate power of dispensation, by
which, in view of the sad necessity of the times, he can admit to the
sacred offices those born during their parents’ priesthood, who are
fitted for it by their education and purity of life. A second epistle
on the same subject attests the perplexity of the pope, recalling to
Anselm’s recollection his former injunctions, and recommending that,
as there was no personal guilt involved, those of the proscribed class
who were in orders should, if worthy of their positions, be allowed
to retain them, without the privilege of advancement.<a id="FNanchor_675_675" href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">675</a> The question,
indeed, was hotly debated. There is extant a letter written
about this time by Thibaut of Étampes, a dignitary of Oxford, to a
certain Rosceline, who with more zeal than discretion had promulgated
the doctrine that the sons of priests were canonically ineligible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
to ordination. Thibaut characterizes this as not only an innovation,
but a blasphemy, and seems utterly unconscious that there was any
authority for such a rule.<a id="FNanchor_676_676" href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">676</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It may be remarked that thus far the proceedings of the reformers
were directed solely against the marriage of ecclesiastics. It may
possibly be that this arose from general conjugal virtue, and that,
satisfied with the privilege, no other disorders prevailed among the
clergy; but it is more probable that the heresy of marriage was so
heinous in the eyes of the sacerdotalists, that it rendered all other
sins venial, and that such other sins might be tacitly passed over in
the endeavor to put an end to the greater enormity. Be this as it
may, the stubborn wilfulness of the offenders only provoked increasing
rigor on the part of the authorities. We have seen that the
council of 1102 produced little result, and that when the secular
power interfered to enforce its canons, the church, jealous of its
privileges, protested, so that many priests retained their wives, and
marriage was still openly practised. King Henry, therefore, at
length, in 1108, summoned another council to assemble in London,
where he urged the bishops to prosecute the good work, and pledged
his power to their support.<a id="FNanchor_677_677" href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">677</a> Fortified by this and by the consent of
the barons, they promulgated a series of ten canons, whose stringent
nature and liberal denunciation of penalties prove that the prelates
felt themselves strengthened by the royal co-operation and thus able
to compel obedience. The Nicene canon was declared the unalterable
law of the church; those ecclesiastics who had disregarded the decrees
of the previous council were debarred from performing their functions
if longer contumacious; any priest requiring to see his wife was only
to do so in the open air and in the presence of two legitimate witnesses;
accusations of guilt were to be met by regular canonical
purgation, a priest requiring six compurgators, a deacon four, and a
subdeacon two, each of his own order. Disobedience to these canons
was declared punishable with deprivation of function and benefice,
expulsion from the church, and infamy. Only eight days of grace
were allowed; further persistence in wrong-doing being visited with
instant excommunication, and confiscation to the bishops of the private
property of the transgressors and of their women, together with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
the persons of the latter. A very significant clause, moreover, shows
that grasping officials had discovered the speculative value of previous
injunctions, and that the degrading custom of selling indulgence
was already in common use, for the council required of all archdeacons
and deans, under penalty of forfeiture, an oath that they
would not receive money for conniving at infractions of the rule,
nor permit priests who kept women to celebrate mass or to employ
vicars to officiate for them.<a id="FNanchor_678_678" href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">678</a></p>

<p>From the account of the historian, we may assume these to be
rather acts of parliament than canons of a council, and that the
assembly was convened for the special purpose of devising measures
for subduing the recalcitrant clergy. The temporal power was thus
pledged to enforce the regulations, and as so enterprising and resolute
a monarch as Henry had undertaken the reform, there can be
little doubt that he prosecuted it with vigor. Anselm died in 1109,
and the clergy rejoiced in the hope that their persecution would cease
with the removal of their persecutor, but the king proceeded to enforce
the regulations of the council of London with more vigor than
ever, and soon obtained at least an outward show of obedience.
Eadmer darkly intimates that this resulted in a great increase of
shocking crimes committed with those relatives whose residence was
allowed, and he is at some pains to argue that Anselm and his
attempted reforms were not responsible for an effect so little contemplated
in their well-meant endeavors. Finally, the ardor of the
king cooled off; ecclesiastical officials were found readily accessible
to bribes for permitting female intercourse, and those who had grown
tired of the wives from whom they had been separated found no
difficulty in forming more desirable unions with new ones. Eadmer
sorrowfully adds that by this time there were few indeed who continued
to preserve the purity with which Anselm had labored so
strenuously to adorn his clergy.<a id="FNanchor_679_679" href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">679</a></p>

<p>The evil influences of this laxity in the Anglican church were not
altogether confined to Britain. At that period the Swedish bishoprics
were frequently filled by Englishmen, and it is quite possible that
from them was derived the laxity which, as we have seen, at a later
period, caused the Swedes to be regarded as heretics adhering to the
Greek schism. An incident occurring about this time shows the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
wisdom of the church in her endeavors to sunder the earthly ties of
her ministers. An English priest named Edward was promoted to
the Swedish episcopate of Scaren. Unluckily, he had left a wife
behind him in England, and, after a short residence in his new dignity
had enabled him to collect together the treasures of his see, he
absconded with them to his spouse, leaving his diocese widowed and
penniless.<a id="FNanchor_680_680" href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">680</a></p>

<p>At length the condition of the church in England attracted the
attention of the pontiffs who had bestowed so much fruitless energy
on the morals of the Continental priesthood; and Honorius II. sent
Cardinal John of Crema to England, for the purpose of restoring
its discipline. In September, 1126, the legate held a council in
London, where he caused the adoption of a canon menacing with
degradation all those in orders who did not abstain from the society
of their wives, or of other women liable to suspicion;<a id="FNanchor_681_681" href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">681</a> and the expressions
employed show that previous legislation had been altogether
nugatory. That the cardinal’s endeavors excited the opposition of
at least a powerful portion of the clergy is fairly deducible from the
unlucky adventure which put a sudden termination to his mission.
After fiercely denouncing the concubines of priests and expatiating
on the burning shame that the body of Christ should be made by
one who had but just left the side of a harlot, he was that very night
surprised in the company of a courtesan, though he had on the same
day celebrated mass; and the suggestion that he had been entrapped
by his enemies, while it did not palliate his guilt, may be assumed
to indicate the power and determination of those who opposed his
reforms.<a id="FNanchor_682_682" href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">682</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span></p>

<p>The energy of the reformers and the stubborn obstinacy of the
clergy are alike manifested by the council of Westminster, held the
following year, which found it necessary to repeat the prohibition
and to guard it with stringent provisions, based upon those of 1108.<a id="FNanchor_683_683" href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">683</a>
This, however, proved as ineffectual as its predecessors, and another
effort was made the next year under auspices which promised a happier
result. King Henry seemed suddenly to recover the holy zeal
which had lain dormant for a score of years, and in the summer of
1129 he convened a great assembly of all the bishops, archdeacons,
abbots, priors, and canons of England, who found that they were
summoned to meet for the purpose of putting an end to the immorality
of the clergy. After long discussion, it was decreed that
all who should not put away their wives by St. Andrew’s day (November
30th) should be deprived of their functions, their churches,
and their houses; and the assembly separated, intrusting to the
zealous sovereign the execution of the decree. Perhaps Henry
remembered how St. Anselm had interfered in 1106 to protect the
guilty clergy from the royal extortioners; perhaps the experience of
his long reign had shown him the fruitlessness of endeavoring to
impose an impossible virtue on carnal-minded men. His exchequer,
as usual, was in danger of collapse. The whole transaction may
have been a deeply-laid scheme to extort money, or the sudden
promptings of temptation may have been too powerful for his self-denial—who
now can tell? We only know that he at once put into
action an extended system of “cullagium,” and having, by the blind
simplicity of his prelates, the temporalities of nearly all the minor
clergy in his power, he proceeded to traffic in exemptions shamelessly
and on the largest scale. As a financial device, the plan was a good
one; he realized a vast sum of money, and his afflicted priests were
at least able to show their superiors a royal license to marry or to
keep their concubines in peace.<a id="FNanchor_684_684" href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">684</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The repetition of almost identical enactments, year after year,
with corresponding infinitesimal results, grows wearisome and mo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>notonous.
If, therefore, I refer to the synod of Westminster, held
in 1138, by the papal legate Alberic, Bishop of Ostia, which deprived
of function and benefice all married and concubinary ecclesiastics,<a id="FNanchor_685_685" href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">685</a>
it is only to observe that no notice was taken of the doctrine
of the invalidity of sacerdotal marriage, which at that period Innocent
II. was engaged in promulgating. So, if I allude to an epistle
of Lucius II. in 1144, reprehending the general English custom by
which sons succeeded to the churches of their fathers, it is merely
to chronicle the commencement of the direct efforts of the popes,
fruitlessly continued during the remainder of the century, to abolish
that wide-spread and seemingly ineradicable abuse.<a id="FNanchor_686_686" href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">686</a></p>

<p>What was the condition of the church resulting from these prolonged
and persistent efforts may be guessed from one or two examples.
When, in 1139, Nigel, Bishop of Ely, revolted against King
Stephen, he intrusted the defence of his castle of Devizes to his concubine,
Maud of Ramsbury. She bravely fulfilled her charge and
repulsed the assaults of the king, until he bethought him of a way
to compel a surrender. Obtaining possession of Roger, son of Maud
and Nigel, the unhappy youth was brought before the walls, and
preparations were made to hang him in his mother’s sight. At this
her courage gave way, and she capitulated at once.<a id="FNanchor_687_687" href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">687</a> Though the
monkish chronicler stigmatizes Maud as “pellex episcopi,” she may
probably have been his wife—in either case the publicity of the connection
is a sufficient commentary on the morals and manners of the
age which took no exception to the elevation of Richard Fitz-Neal,
another son of the same reverend prelate, to the bishopric of London
and to the post of treasurer to King Henry II.</p>

<p>If this be attributed to the unbridled turbulence of Stephen’s
reign, we may turn to the comparatively calmer times of Henry II.,
when Alexander III., amid his ceaseless efforts to restore the church
discipline of England, in 1171, ordered the Bishops of Exeter and
Worcester and the Abbot of Feversham to examine and report as to
the evil reputation of Clarembald, abbot-elect of St. Augustine’s of
Canterbury. In the execution of this duty they found that that
venerable patriarch had seventeen bastards in one village; purity he
ridiculed as an impossibility, while even licentiousness had no attrac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>tion
for his exhausted senses unless spiced with the zest of publicity.<a id="FNanchor_688_688" href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">688</a>
That a man whose profligacy was so openly and shamelessly defiant
could be elected to the highest place in the oldest and most honored
religious community in England is a fact which lends color to the
assertion of a writer of the time of King John, that clergy and laity
were indistinguishably bad,<a id="FNanchor_689_689" href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">689</a> and perhaps justifies the anecdote told
of Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln, who assumed that the clergy were
much worse than the laity.<a id="FNanchor_690_690" href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">690</a> How little these scandals shocked the
public is shown by the fact that it required papal interference to
cause the reformation of the nunnery of Avesbury. The abbess
had borne three children and the nuns, as the chronicler informs us,
were worse than their superior, but when Alexander forced an
investigation no canonical punishment was inflicted on the guilty.
Such of the nuns as promised to live chastely in future were allowed
to remain, and the rest were simply dismissed, while the abbess was
pensioned liberally with ten marks a year to preserve her from disgrace
and want. The vacancies thus created were filled with nuns
from Fontevraud, who proved to be as bad as those whom they
replaced.<a id="FNanchor_691_691" href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">691</a> The same insensibility is manifested in a legal transaction
of the period, when Witgar, the priest of Mendlesham, desired
to secure the reversion of his benefice to his son Nicholas, and applied
to the patron of his church, Martin, Abbot of Battle Abbey,
who agreed to conform to his wishes on condition that the annual
payment exacted from the church in question should be increased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
from ten shillings to forty. Witgar agreed, and on an appointed
day, accompanied by his son, he met the abbot and his attendants at
Colchester, where oaths were publicly interchanged and a formal
agreement was entered into.<a id="FNanchor_692_692" href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">692</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The efforts of Alexander and his successors were seconded by frequent
national and local synods, to whose special injunctions it is
scarcely worth while to refer in full. One noticeable point about
them, however, is that the term “wife” disappears, and is replaced
by “concubina” or “focaria”—the latter meaning a person who was
a permanent occupant of the priest’s hearth, but was not recognized
by the authorities as a lawful wife. Deans and archdeacons were
enjoined to hunt up these illegal companions, but from the frequency
of the injunctions, we may safely conclude that the search was not
often successful, and that the officials found the duty assigned to
them too difficult or too unprofitable for execution. That it was not
impossible, however, when earnestly undertaken, is shown by the
readiness with which King John unearthed the unfortunate creatures
when it suited his policy to do so. During the long dispute over the
election of Giraldus Cambrensis to the see of St. David’s, the king,
who was resolved that no Welshman should hold that preferment,
instructed his officers, in 1202, to seize the women of all the cathedral
chapter who persisted in supporting Giraldus.<a id="FNanchor_693_693" href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">693</a> The measure was
doubtless an efficacious one, and he repeated it when, in 1208, he
persecuted the clergy in his blind impotence of wrath at the interdict
set upon his kingdom by Innocent III. Discerning in these quasi-conjugal
relations the tenderest spot in which to strike those who had
rebelled against his authority by obeying the interdict, and at the
same time as the surest and readiest means of extorting money,
among his other schemes of spoliation he caused all these women to
be seized, and then forced the unfortunate churchmen to buy their
partners back at exorbitant prices.<a id="FNanchor_694_694" href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">694</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span></p>

<p>The ease, indeed, with which the eyes of the officials were blinded
to that which was patent to the public was the subject of constantly
recurring legislation, the reiteration and increasing violence of which
bears irrefragable testimony at once to its necessity and its impotence.
Not only in grave synods and pastorals was the abuse reprehended
and deplored, but it offered too favorable a subject for popular animadversion
to escape the shafts of satire. In the preceding century,
Thomas à Becket, in a vehement attack upon simony, includes this
among the many manifestations of that multiform sin—</p>

<p>There were few more popular poems in the Middle Ages than the
“Apocalypsis Goliæ,” the more than doubtful authorship of which,
at the close of the twelfth or beginning of the thirteenth century, is
claimed for Walter Mapes in England and Gautier de Châtillon in
France; and the enduring reputation of which is attested by an
English version as late as the sixteenth century. The author, whoever
he be, inveighing against the evil courses of the archdeacons,
assumes that the extortion of the “cullagium” was almost universal.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the thirteenth century, Peter de Vinea also
has his fling at the same corruption, and though the part he took in
the fierce quarrels between his master Frederic II. and the papacy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
renders him perhaps a prejudiced witness, still his ample experience
of the disorders of the church makes him an experienced one.</p>

<p>The example which King John had set, however instructive, was
not appreciated by the ecclesiastical authorities, and the “focariæ”
were allowed to remain virtually undisturbed, at least to such an
extent as to render them almost universal. Although by rigid
churchmen they were regarded as mere concubines, there can be little
doubt that the tie between them and the priests was of a binding
nature, which appears to have wanted none of the rites essential to
its entire respectability. Giraldus Cambrensis, who died at an advanced
age about the year 1220, speaks of these companions being
publicly maintained by nearly all the parish priests in England and
Wales. They arranged to have their benefices transmitted to their
sons, while their daughters were married to the sons of other priests,
thus establishing an hereditary sacerdotal caste in which marriage
appears to have been a matter of course.<a id="FNanchor_698_698" href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">698</a> In 1202 the Bishop of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
Exeter complained to Innocent III. of the numerous sons of parish
priests and vicars who seized their churches and claimed to hold
them of right, actually appealing to Rome when he sought to interfere
with them. Innocent of course ordered their removal and subjection
to discipline without appeal: but the evil continued, and in 1205 we
find him writing on the subject to the Bishop of Winchester whom
he required to eject the sons of priests who in many cases held their
father’s benefices.<a id="FNanchor_699_699" href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">699</a> The propriety of the connection, and the hereditary
ecclesiastical functions of the offspring are quaintly alluded to in
a poem of the period, wherein a logician takes a priest to task for
entertaining such a partner—</p>

<p>Even the holy virgins, spouses of Christ, seem to have claimed
and enjoyed the largest liberty. To this period is attributed a homily
addressed to nuns, which earnestly dissuades them from leaving their
blessed state and subjecting themselves to the cares and toils inseparable
from matrimony. The writer appeals to no rules of ecclesiastical
law that could be enforced to prevent them from following
their choice, but labors drearily to prove that they would not better
their condition, either in this world or the next, by forsaking their
heavenly bridegroom for an earthly one.—“And of godes brude. and
his freo dohter. for ba to gederes ha is; bicumeth theow under mon

<p>Innocent III. had not overlooked such a state of discipline, especially
after the transactions between himself and John had rendered
him the suzerain of England, and doubly responsible for the morals
of the Anglican Church. Thus as early as 1203 we find him expressing
to the Bishop of Norwich his surprise that priests in his
diocese contend that they can retain their benefices after having sol<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>emnly
contracted marriage in the face of the church. All such are
peremptorily ordered to be removed without appeal, either by the
bishop himself, or by his superior in cases in which he had personally
conferred the preferment.<a id="FNanchor_702_702" href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">702</a> His zealous efforts to effect an impossible
reform are chronicled by a rhymer of the period, who enters fully
into the dismay of the good pastors at the prospect of the innovation,
and who argues their cause with all the sturdy common-sense
of the Anglo-Saxon mind.</p>

<p>Nor were the Anglican bishops remiss in seconding the efforts of
the pope to break down the opposition which thus openly defied their
power and ventured even to justify the heresy of sacerdotal marriage.
Councils were held which passed canons more stringent than ever;
bishops issued constitutions and pastorals denouncing the custom;
inquests were organized to traverse the dioceses and investigate the
household of every priest. The women especially were attacked.
Christian sepulture was denied them; property left to them and
their children by their partners in guilt was confiscated to the
bishops; churching after childbirth was interdicted to them; and, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
still contumacious after a due series of warnings, they were to be
handed over to the secular arm for condign punishment.<a id="FNanchor_704_704" href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">704</a> How much
all this bustling legislation effected is best shown by the declaration
of the legate, Cardinal Otto, in 1237, at the great council of London.
He deplores the fact that married men received orders and held
benefices while still retaining their wives, and did not hesitate to
acknowledge their children as legitimate by public deeds and witnesses.
After descanting upon the evils of this neglect of discipline, he orders
that all married clerks shall be deprived of preferment and benefice,
that their property shall not descend to wife or children, but to their
churches, and that their sons shall be incapable of holy orders unless
specially dispensed for eminent merit; then turning upon concubinary
priests, he inveighs strongly against their licentiousness, and decrees
that all guilty of the sin shall within thirty days dismiss their women
forever, under pain of suspension from function and benefice until
full satisfaction, persistent contumacy being visited with deprivation.
The archbishops and bishops are commanded to make thorough
inquisition throughout all the deaneries, to bring offenders to light,
and also to put an end to the iniquitous practice of ordaining the
offspring of such connections as successors in their father’s benefices.<a id="FNanchor_705_705" href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">705</a></p>

<p>This legislation produced much excitement, and the legate even
had fears for his life. Some prelates, indeed, maintained that it
only was binding on the church of England during the residence of
Otto, but they were overruled, and it remained at least nominally in
force and was frequently referred to subsequently as the recognized
law in such matters. Its effect was considerable, and some of the
bishops endeavored to carry out its provisions with energy, as may be
presumed from a constitution of William of Cantilupe, Bishop of
Worcester, issued in 1240, ordering his officials to investigate diligently
whether any of the clergy of the diocese had concubines or
were married.<a id="FNanchor_706_706" href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">706</a></p>

<p>To this period and to the disturbance caused by these proceedings are
doubtless to be attributed several satirical pieces of verse describing
the excitement occurring among the unfortunate clerks thus attacked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
in their tenderest spot. The opening lines of one of these poems
indicate the novelty and unexpectedness of the new regulations:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">

  <div class="verse">Quisquis timet graviter pro sua puella.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="pnind">The author then describes a great council, attended by more than ten
thousand ecclesiastics, assembled to deliberate on the course to be
pursued in so delicate a conjuncture. An old priest commences—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>Another poem of similar character describes a chapter held by all
orders and grades to consider the same question. The various speakers
declare their inability to obey the new rule, except two, whose age
renders them indifferent. A learned doctor exclaims—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Omnis debet clericus habere concubinam;</div>
  <div class="verse">Hoc dixit qui coronam gerit auro trinam:</div>
  <div class="verse">Hanc igitur retinere decet disciplinam.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="pnind">The general belief in the legality of the connection is shown by the
remark of another—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Surgens unus presbyter turba de totali ...</div>
  <div class="verse">“Unam” dixit “teneo amore legali,</div>
  <div class="verse">Quam nolo dimittere pro lege tali.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="pnind">Another expects to escape by paying his “cullagium”—</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="pnind">Another urges the indiscriminate immorality attending upon the
attempt to enforce an impossible asceticism—</p>

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span></p>
<p class="pnind">And at length the discussion closes with the speech of a Dominican,
who ends his remarks by predicting—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Habebimus clerici duas concubinas:</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Notwithstanding these flights of the imagination, no organized
resistance was offered to the reform. The clergy sullenly acquiesced,
and submitted to a pressure which was becoming irresistible. The
triumph of the sacerdotal party, however, was gradual, and no exact
limit can be assigned to the recognition of the principle of celibacy.
In 1250 the idea of married priests was still sufficiently prevalent to
lead the populace of London to include matrimony among the accusations
brought against Boniface, Archbishop of Canterbury, when
his tyranny had aroused general resistance;<a id="FNanchor_709_709" href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">709</a> and in 1255 Walter
Kirkham, Bishop of Durham, still felt it necessary to prohibit the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
marriage of his clergy under pain of suspension and deprivation.<a id="FNanchor_710_710" href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">710</a>
It is perhaps noteworthy, however, that, not long after this, Horne,
in his Myrror of Justice, when treating of exceptions to the benefit
of clergy, specifies second marriages, but not single marriages, as
depriving clerks of the privilege of ecclesiastical trial.<a id="FNanchor_711_711" href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">711</a></p>

<p>By this time, however, priestly marriage may be considered to
have become nearly obsolete in England. When, in 1268, the
Cardinal-legate Ottoboni held a great national council in London,
and renewed the constitutions of his predecessor Otto, he made no
allusion to marriage, and only denounced the practice of concubinage,
which he endeavored to eradicate by commanding all archdeacons
to make a thorough inquisition annually into the morals of
the clergy under their jurisdiction.<a id="FNanchor_712_712" href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">712</a> These constitutions of Otto
and Ottoboni long remained the law of the English church, and we
find them constantly referred to in the canons of councils and pastorals
of bishops, ceaselessly laboring to effect the impossible enforcement
of discipline; even as late as 1399 the Archbishop of Canterbury
ordered his suffragans to have them read and explained in the
vernacular in all their episcopal synods.<a id="FNanchor_713_713" href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">713</a> How hard was the task
may be readily conceived when we see, in 1279, the primate Peckham,
Archbishop of Canterbury, applying to Rome for assistance in prosecuting
a certain bishop against whom he had long been vainly endeavoring
to bring the law to bear. A concubine had confessed to
having borne five children to the offender;<a id="FNanchor_714_714" href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">714</a> he had himself admitted
his guilt in a private interview with Peckham, for which he had
afterwards claimed the seal of the confessional; yet the archbishop
complains that his efforts will be unsuccessful unless he is fortified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
with letters from the pope himself. His strict injunctions of secrecy
on his correspondent, and his evident dread lest the criminal’s agents
in Rome should get wind of the application, show how difficult was
the enterprise, and how rarely prelates could be expected to undertake
duties so arduous and so unpromising.<a id="FNanchor_715_715" href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">715</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the man to whom the church owed most for his energy
and activity in promoting the cause of reform was the celebrated
Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln. The leading part which he
took in the political troubles of the stormy reign of Henry III. has
thrown his ecclesiastical character somewhat into the shade, and he
is better known as the friend of Leicester than as the untiring
churchman. Notwithstanding his consistent opposition to Henry
III. and to the encroachments of the papacy, he was the inflexible
enemy of clerical irregularities, and he enforced the decretals
throughout his diocese with as firm a hand as that which he raised
in defence of the rights of the nation and the privileges of the
Anglican church. Thus, in 1251, he made a rigorous inquisition in
his bishopric, forcing all his beneficed clergy to the observance of
the strictest chastity, removing from their houses all suspected women,
and punishing transgressors with deprivation. It is not easy to
approve of his brutal expedient for testing the virtue of the inmates
of his nunneries,<a id="FNanchor_716_716" href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">716</a> the adoption of which could only be justified and
suggested by the conviction that general licentiousness was everywhere
prevalent; and though such treatment of the spouses of Christ
was to the last degree degrading, yet it was doubtless more efficacious
than the ordeal of the Eucharist, which was frequently resorted to
in special cases. Not only, however, did he thus endeavor to reform
the morals of his flock, but he made the closest scrutiny into the
character of applicants for ordination. In this he was largely aided
by his ascetic friend and admirer, Adam de Marisco, and the correspondence
between them shows not only the importance which they
reasonably attached to the subject, but the sleepless vigilance required
to counteract the prevalent immorality of the clergy, and the incredible
laxity with which the patrons of livings bestowed the benefices
in their gift.<a id="FNanchor_717_717" href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">717</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span></p>

<p>The rule was now fairly established and generally acknowledged;
concubinage, though still prevalent—nay, in fact almost universal—was
not defended as a right, but was practised with what concealment
was possible, and was the object of unremitting assault from
councils and prelates. To enter into the details of the innumerable
canons and constitutions directed against the ineradicable vice during
the succeeding half century would be unprofitable. Their endless
iteration is only interesting as proving their inefficacy. A popular
satirist of the reign of Edward II. declares that bribery of the ecclesiastical
officials insured the domestic comfort of the clergy and their
female companions;<a id="FNanchor_718_718" href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">718</a> while in time the canon law seems to have lost
all its terrors. One of the earliest acts of the reign of Henry VII.
was a law empowering the ecclesiastical officials to imprison “priests,
clerks, and religious men” convicted of incontinence, and guaranteeing
them against prosecution by the offenders.<a id="FNanchor_719_719" href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">719</a> That the aid of
the secular legislator should thus have been invoked for protection
under such circumstances showed the audacity resulting from long
immunity, and is the abject confession that the ceaseless labor of
four centuries had utterly failed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In one part of England, however, the reform seems to have penetrated
even more slowly. We have seen above, on the testimony of
Giraldus Cambrensis, that in the early part of the thirteenth century
the marriage of priests and the hereditary transmission of benefices
were almost universal in Wales. As in the wild fastnesses of the
Principality the ecclesiastical regulations seemed powerless, recourse
was had to the secular law, which was employed to inflict various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
disabilities on offenders and their offspring, and the repetition of
these shows how obstinately the custom was adhered to by the clergy
until a comparatively late period. Thus, in the Gwentian and Dimetian
Codes there is a provision that the son of a married priest,
born after the ordination of his father, shall not share in the paternal
estate;<a id="FNanchor_720_720" href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">720</a> and this provision is retained and repeated in a collection of
laws which contains the date of 2 Henry IV., showing it to be posterior
to the year 1400.<a id="FNanchor_721_721" href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">721</a> The same collection enumerates married
priests among “thirteen things corrupting the world, and which will
ever remain in it; and it can never be delivered of them.”<a id="FNanchor_722_722" href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">722</a> In the
same spirit, the Book of Cynog, which is of uncertain date, declares
“nor is a married priest, as he has relinquished his law, to be credited
in law,” and it therefore directs that the testimony of such witnesses
shall not be receivable in court;<a id="FNanchor_723_723" href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">723</a> while another collection of
laws, occurring in a MS. of the fifteenth century, repeats the provision—“their
testimony is not to be credited in any place, and they
are excluded from the law, unless they ask a pardon from the pope
or a bishop, through a public penance.”<a id="FNanchor_724_724" href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">724</a> In fact, we may, perhaps,
almost hazard the conclusion that, notwithstanding the efforts of both
ecclesiastical and secular legislators, sacerdotal marriage scarcely
became obsolete in Wales before it was once more recognized as
legitimate under the Reformation.</p>

<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII">XVIII.</a><br />

IRELAND AND SCOTLAND.</h2>


<p>In a previous section it has already been shown that the rule of
celibacy was observed by the Celtic churches of the British Islands
during a period in which their Christianity was a model for the rest
of Europe. Their religion, however, could not preserve its purity
and simplicity amid the overwhelming barbarism of those dreary
ages. From an ancient commentary on the “Cain Patraic,” or
Patrick’s Law, of uncertain date, but probably belonging to the ninth
or tenth century, it would seem as though there were at that time
two classes of bishops, one bound by monastic vows, the other permitted
to marry; and, what is somewhat singular, the law appears to
favor the latter, for the “cumad espuc,” or virgin bishop, is condemned
to perpetual degradation or to the life of a hermit for offences
which the “bishop of one wife” can redeem by prompt penance.<a id="FNanchor_725_725" href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">725</a></p>

<p>The Feini, prior to the advent of St. Patrick, were far in advance
of the contemporary barbarian tribes, and their conversion to Christianity
introduced a new and powerful element of progress. It was
not lasting, however, and they lapsed into a condition but little
removed from that of savages. The marriage-tie was virtually unknown
or habitually disregarded among the laity.<a id="FNanchor_726_726" href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">726</a> What was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
condition of the clergy may be inferred from the fact that the episcopates
were regarded as the private property of certain families in
which they descended by hereditary succession. Thus, in the primatial
see of Armagh, fifteen archbishops were of one house, the last
eight of whom were married. At length Celsus, who died about the
year 1130, bequeathed the dignity to his friend St. Malachi. The
kindred rose in arms at this infringement of their rights, and two of
their members successively occupied the position, which Malachi was
not able to obtain until the anger of God had miraculously destroyed
the whole family.<a id="FNanchor_727_727" href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">727</a></p>

<p>During all this period the Irish church had been completely independent
of the central authority at Rome, but the extension of
influence resulting from the labors of Hildebrand and his successors
soon began to make itself felt. In the quarrels concerning the succession
of Archbishop Celsus, there figures a certain Bishop Gilbert,
who is described as being the first papal legate seen in Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_728_728" href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">728</a>
When Malachi abandoned Armagh and revived the extinct episcopate
of Down, he resolved on a pilgrimage to Rome to obtain the <i>pallium</i>,
a powerful instrument of papal authority, until then unknown on the
island; and perhaps the opposition manifested to his wishes by his
friends as well as by the authorities may be attributable to a repugnance
towards the gradual encroachments of Romanizing influence.<a id="FNanchor_729_729" href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">729</a></p>

<p>Malachi returned from Rome armed with legatine powers, and
proceeded vigorously with the reforms which he had long before
commenced. He held numerous councils, extirpating abuses everywhere,
renovating the ancient rules of discipline and introducing new
ones, bending all his energies to abrogating the national institutions
and replacing them with those of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_730_730" href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">730</a> The earnest asceticism of
his nature, exaggerated by the training of his youth, led him to give
a strongly monastic character to the church of which he was thus the
second founder. On his journey homeward from Rome, he had
tarried a second time at Clairvaux to see his friend St. Bernard, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
had left there four of his attendants to be exercised in the severe
Cistercian discipline that they might serve as missionaries and as
models for his compatriots, who had heard, indeed, of monkhood, but
had never seen it.<a id="FNanchor_731_731" href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">731</a> His efforts, in this respect, were to a considerable
extent successful, at least in a portion of the island, though his
death in 1149, at the comparatively early age of 54, cut short his
labors before they could yield their full fruit.<a id="FNanchor_732_732" href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">732</a></p>

<p>The incongruous character thus imparted to the Irish church is
described by Giraldus Cambrensis some forty years later. The prelates
were selected from the monasteries, and the church was completely
monastic. Chastity was the only rule of discipline thoroughly
preserved, and Giraldus confesses his wonder that it could be maintained,
in contradiction to all former experience, when gluttony and
drunkenness were carried to excess. The monastic principle of
selfishness was all-pervading, and the pastors took no care of their
flocks. Among the people, marriage was still unknown, incest was
of common occurrence, even the rudiments of Christian faith were left
untaught, and the church was regarded without reverence.<a id="FNanchor_733_733" href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">733</a> His
account of the absence of regular stipends and tithes is confirmed by
the fact that an Irish bishop attending the council of Lateran in
1179, in complaining of the condition of his native church, stated
that his only revenues were derived from three milch cows, which
his flock were bound to replace as they became dry.<a id="FNanchor_734_734" href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">734</a> This poverty,
however apostolic in itself, can only, in an age of magnificent sacerdotalism,
be regarded as an indication of a church whose degradation
could command neither the respect nor the support of its children.
That the reforms of Malachi, one-sided as they were, extended only
over a portion of the island, is evident from the inquiry which, a few
years later, the Archbishop of Cashel addressed to Clement III. as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
to whether the children of bishops could receive orders and hold
benefices; and the exceptional character of the Irish establishment
was recognized by the pope when he decided that they could, provided
they were born in wedlock, and were otherwise worthy of position.<a id="FNanchor_735_735" href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">735</a>
This requisite of legitimacy was apparently not imposed in ignorance,
for at the council of Cashel in 1171 we find an effort made to enforce
Christian marriage among the people, who are still described as indulging
in unrestricted polygamy and disregarding the nearest ties
of consanguinity.<a id="FNanchor_736_736" href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">736</a></p>

<p>When about this period the English commenced the conquest
which was to lead to five centuries of cruel anarchy, they of course
carried with them their civil and ecclesiastical institutions. The
original conquerors—the Butlers, the Clares, and the Fitzgeralds—speedily
became incorporated with the native race, and were as Irish
as the O’Briens and the McCauras. Although the royal authority
was limited practically to the confines of the Pale, and embraced
little beyond the Ostman ports, yet it is easy to understand that the
clerical license habitual to the English spread beyond the political
boundaries, and the monastic spirit of the Hibernians was grievously
wounded by the unchastity which was disseminated like a contagion
from the dissolute priests who followed in the wake of Strong-bow
and Prince John.<a id="FNanchor_737_737" href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">737</a> Not twenty years after the first invasion, a
council, summoned in 1186 by John in Dublin, was troubled by a
quarrel between the Saxon priests of Wexford, who mutually accused
each other of publicly marrying and keeping wives. This being duly
proved, they were promptly degraded, to the intense satisfaction of
the Irish clergy, triumphant in their own comparative purity of
morals.<a id="FNanchor_738_738" href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">738</a> When, therefore, in 1205, Innocent III. specially ordered
his legate, Cardinal Julian, to put an end to the hereditary transmission
of benefices common in Ireland, the abuse to which he
referred was probably confined to the English Pale.<a id="FNanchor_739_739" href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">739</a> The church
establishments, in fact, were distinct, and consequently when an Irish
synod was held in Dublin, in 1217, its canons cannot be considered
as having authority beyond the narrow territory through which the
king’s writ would likewise run. Those canons show us that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
morality of the Saxon priesthood had not improved by the example
made of the priests of Wexford. The denunciations of concubinage
indicate the prevalence of that vice, and the severities threatened
against the unfortunate women contrast strangely with the lenity
shown to their more guilty partners.<a id="FNanchor_740_740" href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">740</a> A century later, if we may
believe the declaration of the synod of Ossory in 1320, the evil continued
to flourish, open, avowed, and universal, resisting alike the
authority of the church and the efforts to repress it by severity.<a id="FNanchor_741_741" href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">741</a>
Whether the offenders dismissed their consorts after the thirty days’
grace allowed by the synod may well be doubted. With the spread
of English domination, the purity of the native church disappeared,
and so great became the general disregard of the canons that shortly
before the Reformation it was not an unusual thing for Irish priests
to be openly married, nor do those who did so seem to have thereby
forfeited the esteem of their neighbors.<a id="FNanchor_742_742" href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">742</a></p>

<p>In Scotland, the Christianity introduced by St. Columba had
fallen into the hands of the Culdees. These were originally monks
of a more than ordinary strictness of discipline, to whom the earliest
recorded allusion occurs in Ireland towards the close of the eighth
century—the name, Céle-dé (Keledeus, or Servus Dei) meaning
simply Servant of God. In the course of time the Culdees had so
relaxed their rule that they reappear in the eleventh century as an
order nominally of monks, yet fulfilling the functions of the secular
clergy, and enjoying free permission to marry, only abstaining from
their wives when employed in the actual ministry of the altar. With
marriage had come the hereditary transmission of the endowments of
the church to their children, so that the ancient abbeys and churches
were well-nigh stripped of all their possessions, and the distinction
between clergy and laity was rather in term than in fact. It may
please the poet to construct a world of his own, peopled by imaginary
beings of angelic purity—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Peace to their shades! The pure Culdees</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Were Albyn’s earliest priests of God,</div>
  <div class="verse">Ere yet an island of her seas</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">By foot of Saxon monk was trod,</div>

  <div class="verse">And Reullura, beauty’s star,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Was the partner of his bower—</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>but in sober truth the Culdees were pure as long as they kept the
tradition of their founder, and it was not until they sank to a level
with their savage compatriots that they transgressed the rule and
became worldly and corrupt.<a id="FNanchor_743_743" href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">743</a> In 1125 the Cardinal-legate, John of
Crema, whose unlucky adventure in London has been already alluded
to, visited Scotland in the execution of his reformatory mission.
There he found on the throne David I., a prince whose life was
devoted to rescuing his subjects from their primæval barbarism. We
know few details of the history of those times, but it is fair to conjecture
that the exhortations of the legate had a share in arousing
David to a realization of the deficiencies and the corruptions of the
Scottish church, and in guiding him to the course which he adopted
in its reformation. After some fruitless efforts to restore the order
of Culdees to its original condition, he resolved on the sweeping
measure of removing all who should prove incorrigible. They were
accordingly turned out bodily from their establishments, such property
as could be traced was restored, and donations on an extended
scale were made both to the old foundations and to the new ones
which the royal reformer established—donations which gained for
him, from an ungodly descendant, the appellation of “Ane soir sanct
for the crown.” These foundations were then filled with regular
clergy, brought from France and England—chiefly canons of the
order of St. Augustin—and the unfortunate Culdees were turned
adrift unless they would promise to observe the strictness of monastic
rule. It is probable that in a few places they did so, for references
to Culdees still occur occasionally even in the next century, but these
measures were effective and practically they and their customs disappeared
together.<a id="FNanchor_744_744" href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">744</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

<p>In a church thus constructed from the regular clergy, the heresy
of marriage could find no foothold, especially as it had been so sternly
punished in the expulsion of the Culdees. Still was the desired
purity not yet attained. In 1181, during the long quarrel between
William the Lion and the papacy on the subject of the archbishopric
of St. Andrews, an interdict was pronounced on all ecclesiastics who
should refuse to recognize the papal candidate John, whereupon the
King persecuted those who obeyed the mandate, and the chronicler,
in expatiating upon his cruelty, is careful to mention that he did
not spare their children, even to babes in their mothers’ arms, who
were remorselessly driven into exile.<a id="FNanchor_745_745" href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">745</a> The state of things indicated
by this remained without improvement. In 1225, Honorius III.
ordered the Scottish ecclesiastics to assemble in council for the correction
of the many enormities which were committed with impunity;
and the council held in obedience to the papal command denounced
the shameless licentiousness of the clergy as a disgrace to the church.<a id="FNanchor_746_746" href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">746</a>
Inquests to detect the offenders, suspension and deprivation to punish
them, were ordered with all the verbal energy of which we have
already witnessed so many examples, and were attended with the
same plentiful lack of success. With what disposition the clergy
regarded these efforts for their improvement we may guess from the
reception which they gave to the constitutions of Cardinal Ottoboni.
Reference has already been made to the council held by that legate
in London in 1268. The church of Scotland had been ordered to
join in this council, and had sent two bishops and two abbots as its
representative delegates. These took home with them the constitutions
of Ottoboni, which the clergy of Scotland utterly refused to
obey.<a id="FNanchor_747_747" href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">747</a></p>

<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX">XIX.</a><br />

SPAIN.</h2>


<p>We have already seen (p. 121) that among the Wisigoths of Spain
the rule of celibacy had never been successfully enforced, and that
during the later period of the Gothic dynasty the demoralization of
the clergy was daily increasing. The Saracenic invasion, and the
subsequent struggles of the Christians, who founded petty kingdoms
among the wild mountainous regions of the North and East of the
Peninsula, were not favorable to the growth of regular discipline and
settled observances. The centralized sacerdotalism of Rome, which
took so remarkable an extension in the ninth and tenth centuries,
and which penetrated every portion of the Carlovingian empire, was
powerless to intrude into the strongholds of the Jalikiah, whence the
descendants of Pelayo and his companions gradually extended their
frontiers from Oviedo to Toledo. Communication with the apostolic
city was rare. The nominal subjection of Barcelona and Navarre to
the Carlovingians, indeed, brought the eastern provinces of Spain
under the domination of the Archbishops of Narbonne, and kept
them, to a certain extent, under the influences which were moulding
the rest of Europe; but the kingdoms of Leon and Castile grew up
in complete ecclesiastical independence. Even at the close of the
eleventh century a Spanish ecclesiastic describes his contemporary
brethren as rude and illiterate, owning no obedience to the mother
church of Rome, and governed by the discipline of Toledo.<a id="FNanchor_748_748" href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">748</a> Wild
and insubordinate as was a large portion of the European clergy, the
ecclesiastics of Spain were even wilder and more insubordinate.
Another writer of the period, himself a canon of Compostella, and
subsequently Bishop of Mondonego, speaking of his brother canons
previous to the reforms of Diego Gelmirez, denounces them as reck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>less
and violent men, ready for any crime, prompt in quarrel, and
even occasionally indulging in mutual slaughter.<a id="FNanchor_749_749" href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">749</a> How little, indeed,
there was to distinguish the clerk from the layman is evident from
a regulation promulgated by the council of Compostella in 1113. It
provides that all priests, gentlemen, and peasants shall devote themselves
to wolf-hunting on every Sunday, except Easter and Pentecost,
under a penalty of a fine of five sols for the priest and gentleman,
and one sol, or a sheep, for the peasant—visitation of the sick being
the only excuse exempting the priest from the performance of this
duty. Every church, moreover, was bound to furnish for the hunt
seven iron-tipped reeds.<a id="FNanchor_750_750" href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">750</a> A similar condition of society is indicated
at the other end of Spain, where, in 1027, the Synod of Elna, in
Roussillon, had forbidden, under pain of excommunication, any one to
attack a monk or a clerk who was without arms.<a id="FNanchor_751_751" href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">751</a></p>

<p>In such lack of social organization it is easy to imagine that the
rule of celibacy received little attention. According to Mariana, the
clergy of the period were, for the most part, publicly married;<a id="FNanchor_752_752" href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">752</a> and
when, in 1056, the council of Compostella specifically forbade to
bishops and monks all intercourse with women, except with mothers,
aunts, and sisters wearing the monastic habit,<a id="FNanchor_753_753" href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">753</a> the inference is fair
that even so elementary a prohibition was an innovation, and that
the secular clergy, below the episcopate, were not regarded as subject
to any restriction.</p>

<p>In the comprehensive efforts, however, made during the later half
of the eleventh century by the Roman church to bring all Christendom
under its domination, the rising states of Spain were not
likely to remain undisturbed in their independent isolation; nor was
it to be expected that so complete a defiance of the canons would be
passed unobserved by the pontiffs who were convulsing the rest of
Europe in their efforts to reform the church. Accordingly, in 1068,
we find the Cardinal Hugo of Silva Candida, as legate of Alexander
II., assembling a council at Girona, and procuring the adoption of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
regulation reducing to the condition of laymanship all who, in holy
orders, either entered into matrimony or kept concubines; while
those who should dismiss their wives were promised immunity for the
past and security for the future.<a id="FNanchor_754_754" href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">754</a> In 1077, Gregory VII. sent a
certain Bishop Amandus as his legate, with an epistle addressed to
the Spaniards, in which he told them that Spain had anciently
belonged to St. Peter and the Roman church; that the carelessness
of his predecessors, and the Saracenic conquest, had caused the papal
rights to be forgotten, but that the time had come for them to be
revendicated, and that he consequently claimed implicit obedience.<a id="FNanchor_755_755" href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">755</a>
Accordingly, in 1078, we find the legate presiding over another
council at Girona, which confirmed the canons of the previous one,
and added several others to prevent the ordination of sons of priests,
and the hereditary transmission of benefices.<a id="FNanchor_756_756" href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">756</a> Such slender reforms
as may have resulted from these efforts were probably confined to
Catalonia and Aragon; but not long afterwards influences were
brought to bear upon the rest of Spain, which had a powerful effect
in extending the authority of Rome over the Peninsula. Constance
of Burgundy, Queen of Alfonso VI. of Castile and Leon, prevailed
upon her husband to ask of Gregory a legate to reform the church,
and to condemn the Gothic or Mozarabic ritual, which was jealously
preserved by the people as a symbol of their independent nationality.
The prayer, of course, was granted. Richard, Abbot of Marseilles,
was sent, and in 1080 he held a council at Burgos, where he commanded
the ordained clergy to put away their wives. The novelty
and hardship of this order created great excitement. The pope, who
was rightly regarded as its author, became the object of no little
abuse and insult, and was held up to popular derision in innumerable
lampoons.<a id="FNanchor_757_757" href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">757</a></p>

<p>All of these efforts were nugatory. The Spaniards, engaged in an
interminable and often doubtful struggle with the Infidel, might well
claim consideration from the Holy Father, while the independent
spirit which they manifested in their resistance to the introduction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
the Roman ritual was a warning that it would be prudent not to
proceed too abruptly in the process of bringing them within the fold
of St. Peter. Whatever be the motives, indeed, which induced such
strenuous apostles of celibacy as Gregory, Urban, Paschal, and
Calixtus to abstain from urging upon them the reform which was so
earnestly enforced elsewhere, certain it is that little effort was made
to deprive the Spanish clergy of their wives. In all the epistles of
the popes up to 1130 I can find but one allusion to the subject,
though communication between Spain and Italy became daily more
frequent, and the papal authority was constantly exercised with
greater decisiveness in the internal affairs of the Spanish church.</p>

<p>When, in 1101, Diego Gelmirez succeeded in obtaining the see of
Compostella, Paschal II. addressed him an epistle, reproaching him
with the utter contempt of discipline in his diocese, and commanding
a reform. He chiefly complained of the incongruous common residence
of monks and nuns, which he severely condemned and peremptorily
prohibited, but he made some concession to the necessities
of the time in permitting the ordination of the sons of those priests
who had, “according to the ordinary custom of the country,” married
prior to the promulgation of what the pope significantly termed
the Roman law; and he carefully abstained from ordering a separation
between them and their wives, or even an enforcement of the
canons for the future.<a id="FNanchor_758_758" href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">758</a></p>

<p>Diego, who possessed no common measure of vigor and ambition,
and who needed the particular favor of the popes for the success of
his plans in elevating and aggrandizing his see, accordingly proceeded
to reform his clergy. There is extant a minute and circumstantial
contemporary history of his episcopate, written by his admiring disciples,
who dwell with much instance on his labors and success in
reducing to discipline the refractory canons of his cathedral seat;
but in the numerous allusions to these reforms there is no mention
of the enforcement of celibacy, while the fact that he would not
allow them to minister at the altar without canonical vestments is
made the subject of repeated gratulation and praise.<a id="FNanchor_759_759" href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">759</a> The absolute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
silence of the authors with respect to the clergy at large shows that
the reticence of Pope Paschal was not misunderstood, and that there
was no effort made to bring the secular priesthood under subjection
to the Roman discipline. In the twenty-five canons of the council
of Compostella in 1113 it therefore need not surprise us that there
is no reference whatever to the subject, beyond an allusion to the
children of ecclesiastics, whose nurses were declared entitled to
clerical privileges, thus giving them a recognized and highly prized
position.<a id="FNanchor_760_760" href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">760</a></p>

<p>That Diego’s reforms, indeed, did not extend to the abrogation of
clerical marriage is evident from several incidental circumstances.
Thus, in 1114, the lords of the monastery of Botoa made it over to
the church of Santiago of Compostella, reserving to themselves their
life interest, with a reversion to any of their descendants who should
be ecclesiastics, and who might be willing to profess celibacy, showing
that the matter was optional with the secular clergy.<a id="FNanchor_761_761" href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">761</a> That
even the canons were bound by no absolute rules on the subject is
manifested by a very curious transaction which may be worth
recounting as illustrative in several aspects of the spirit of the age.
In 1127, Diego, at the head of his Gallician troops, accompanied
Alfonso VIII. on an expedition into Portugal. On their return, the
army halted at Compostella, where the archbishop received and entertained
his sovereign. They were bound by the closest ties, for Diego
had baptized, knighted, and crowned him, and had, moreover, constantly
stood his friend throughout his stormy youth, in the endless
civil wars which marked the disastrous reign of his mother, Queen
Urraca. Yet, prompted by evil counsellors who were jealous of
Diego, the king suddenly demanded of him an enormous sum of
money, to pay off the army, under threat of seizing and pillaging
the city. After considerable resistance, Diego was forced to submit,
and to pay a thousand marks of silver. He then sought a private
interview, in which he solemnly and affectionately warned Alfonso
of the ruin of his soul which would ensue if he did not undergo
penance for thus impiously spoiling the Apostle Santiago. Alfonso
listened humbly, and professed entire willingness to repent,
but for the difficulty that he had always been taught that penitence
was fruitless without restitution, and restitution he was unable and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
unwilling to make. Diego then suggested that he should meet the
chapter and discuss the case, to which he graciously assented. In
the assembly which followed, Diego proposed that the king should
follow the example of his father, Raymond of Gallicia, in commending
himself to the peculiar patronage of Santiago, and in bequeathing
his body to be buried in their church, promising, moreover, that if
he should do so they would pray specially for him, which, from the
promise of his youth, bade fair to be no easy task. Alfonso was
delighted to escape so easily: he eagerly accepted the proposition,
and added that he would like to become a canon of their church, in
order to enjoy the fullest possible share in the Masses of such holy
men. To this the chapter assented at once; he was forthwith duly
installed as a canon of the church which he had just despoiled, and
his conscience was set at rest, while the church felt that it had
acquired a moral supremacy over the spoiler.<a id="FNanchor_762_762" href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">762</a> In thus formally
becoming a canon, there could have been no assumption of celibacy,
expressed or implied. Alfonso was but twenty-one years of age,
and in the following year he married Berengaria, daughter of the
Count of Barcelona.<a id="FNanchor_763_763" href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">763</a></p>

<p>In fact, in the absence of urgency on the part of Rome, the question
of sacerdotal celibacy seems to have been virtually ignored in
Spain. How little importance was attached to the preëminent sanctity
of asceticism becomes evident when we are told that in the whole
of Gallicia there was no convent of nuns until Diego, in 1129,
founded the house of S. Maria of Conjo.<a id="FNanchor_764_764" href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">764</a> Equal indifference is
manifested in the legislative assemblies of the church. The council
of Leon and Compostella, in 1114, only prohibited the residence of
such women as were forbidden by the canons,<a id="FNanchor_765_765" href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">765</a> which, in the existing
discipline of the Spanish church, may safely be presumed to offer no
impediment to the marriage relation; and a synod held at Palencia
in 1129 is even more significant in its reticence, for it merely provides
that notorious concubines of the clergy shall be ejected, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
apparently venturing to threaten any punishment on the reverend
offenders.<a id="FNanchor_766_766" href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">766</a></p>

<p>Towards the close of his restless life, however, Archbishop Diego
found time, amid his military, political, and ecclesiastical schemes of
aggrandizement, to undertake the much needed reform of a single
monastery. The Abbot of S. Pelayo de Antealtaria was a paragon
of brutish sensuality, who wasted the revenues of his house in riotous
living and took no shame in a numerous progeny. The archbishop
remonstrated with him long and earnestly, both in public and private:
seven times in the general chapter of the diocese he admonished
and threatened the offender without result. At length, in
1130, after forbearance so remarkable, Diego held a chapter in the
abbey for his trial, when he was proved by competent witnesses to
have kept no less than seventy concubines. He was accordingly
deposed, but was so far from being canonically punished that a benefice
in the abbey lands was assigned for his support. A new abbot
was then appointed, who swore to observe the Benedictine rule as
far as he should find himself able to do so.<a id="FNanchor_767_767" href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">767</a> It is a significant commentary
on the state of discipline and opinion to find so weak an
effort to remove and punish the grossest licentiousness characterized
by the biographer of Diego with the warmest expressions of wondering
admiration as a work which doubtless gave ineffable satisfaction
to the Divine Omnipotence, and which was without example in
previous history.</p>

<p>It is very evident that the pontiffs who so energetically enforced
the rule of celibacy throughout the rest of Europe were content to
offer little opposition to the obstinacy of the Celtiberian priesthood.
We can safely conclude, indeed, that matters were allowed to remain
virtually undisturbed, and that the clergy were permitted to retain
their wives. A council held in Gallicia in the early part of the
thirteenth century, for the purpose of reforming ecclesiastical discipline,
preserves absolute silence on the subject of marriage and
concubinage;<a id="FNanchor_768_768" href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">768</a> and, about the middle of the same century, we find
Alfonso the Wise of Castile obliged to formally interdict matrimony
to those in holy orders. In the elaborate code drawn up by that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
monarch and known as “Las Siete Partidas,” there is a law punishing
sacerdotal marriage with deprivation of function and benefice;
while the wives, if vassals of the church, are to be reduced to servitude,
and if serfs, are to be sold and the proceeds appropriated for
the benefit of the church of the offender. The wording of the law
would seem to indicate that it was an enactment intended to repress
existing disorders, and not merely a well-known provision inserted
in the code for the purpose of completing a compilation of statutes;<a id="FNanchor_769_769" href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">769</a>
while the existence in secular legislation of such invasions of the
province of ecclesiastical law is a convincing proof of the continued
independence of Rome asserted by the Spanish church and state.
The prelates were further authorized to command the assistance of
the secular power in enforcing these barbarous penalties to their
full measure of severity, and this secular legislation seems to have
accomplished what the ecclesiastical authorities had so utterly failed
to effect. After this we hear little of regular marriage, which was replaced
by promiscuous concubinage or by permanent irregular unions.</p>

<p>In Valencia a council in 1255 prohibited the residence with
priests of all women, except mothers and sisters and such others
as were beyond suspicion, but no penalty was prescribed for infractions
of the rule; and the character of the clergy with whom the
council had to deal is sufficiently shown by its complaint that the
priests of the country parishes frequented the city too much and
indulged there in disgraceful excesses, for which reason it forbids
them from visiting the city more often than twice a month, and
requires them to return home the same day.<a id="FNanchor_770_770" href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">770</a> Arnaldo de Peralta,
Bishop of Valencia, not long after, deplores the utter contempt with
which all previous efforts to suppress clerical concubinage had been
received, and the prevalence of the custom by which ecclesiastics
endowed their bastards with the spoils of the church. Yet the only
punishment he finds himself able to threaten is a fine of thirty
maravedis on public concubinarians and of five on parish priests who
connive at such offences or neglect to report them to the bishop.
Ecclesiastics, indeed, are directed to put away their children, but no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
penalty is indicated for disobedience.<a id="FNanchor_771_771" href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">771</a> The council of Gerona in
1257 was more energetic, for it decreed the deprivation of all concubinary
priests who persisted in their sin, but this apparently was not
effectual, for in 1274 the threat was repeated, with the addition that
the women should be excommunicated and should receive after death
the burial of asses;<a id="FNanchor_772_772" href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">772</a> and very similar was the legislation of the
council of Peñafiel in 1302.<a id="FNanchor_773_773" href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">773</a> However well meant these efforts
were, they proved as useless as all previous ones, for in 1322 the
council of Valladolid, under the presidency of the papal legate
William Bishop of Sabina, animadverts strongly on the indecency
of ecclesiastics, from the highest prelates down, officiating at the
nuptials of their children, both legitimate and illegitimate. For
those who publicly kept concubines it provides a graduated scale of
confiscation, ending in the deprivation of the persistently contumacious
who gave no prospect of amendment, the exceedingly elaborate
regulations prescribed showing at once the difficulty of the subject
and the importance attached to it. The acts of this council,
moreover, are interesting as presenting the first authentic evidence
of a custom which subsequently prevailed to some extent elsewhere,
by which parishioners were wont to compel their priest to take a
female consort for the purpose of protecting the virtue of their
families from his assaults. The iniquity of this precaution seems to
have especially scandalized the legate, and he treats the audacious
laymen concerned in such transactions with much less ceremony than
the concubinary clergy.<a id="FNanchor_774_774" href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">774</a> The elaborate regulations promulgated by
this council produced little effect. The council of Salamanca in
1335 renews the previous repressive legislation, adding a threat of
<i>ipso facto</i> excommunication for those who give Christian burial to
priestly concubines, including all who are present on such occasions,
who are not to be absolved until they shall have paid a fine of fifty
maravedis to the cathedral church.<a id="FNanchor_775_775" href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">775</a> At length, in 1388, a national
council held at Palencia under Cardinal Pedro de Luna, papal
legate, made a determined effort to eradicate the ineradicable vice.
It renewed the regulations of the council of Valladolid, which it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
stated were not obeyed, and added to them a clause by which all
benefices were held under a sort of tenure of chastity, and subject
to forfeiture. Besides this, all ecclesiastics who, within two months
of death, had kept concubines, were declared incapable of testating,
and their property was adjudged, one-third to the fabric of their
churches, one-third to the Ordinary of the diocese, and one-third to
the fund for the redemption of captives under the care of the Orders
of Trinidad and Mercede, who were empowered to seize their share.
Moreover, all bishops were commanded to appoint official Visitors,
who were to report at annual synods, to be held thereafter, all cases
of infraction of the rules.<a id="FNanchor_776_776" href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">776</a> The desolation which the enforcement
of such regulations would have wrought may be inferred from the
description which a contemporary, Alvarez Pelayo, Bishop of Silva
in Portugal, gives us of his fellow ecclesiastics. He states that
many of the clergy in holy orders throughout the Peninsula publicly
associated themselves with women, frequently of noble blood, binding
themselves against separation by notarial acts and solemn oaths,
endowing their consorts with the goods of the church, and celebrating
with the kindred these illegal espousals as joyously as
though they were legitimate nuptials. Yet even this flagrant defiance
of the canons was better than the wickedness common between
confessors and their penitents, or than the promiscuous and unrestrained
licentiousness of those who were not fettered by the forms
of marriage, whose children, as Pelayo asserts, almost rivalled in
number those of the laity.<a id="FNanchor_777_777" href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">777</a> These excesses were not suppressed by
the council of Palencia. In 1429 the council of Tortosa, under the
presidency of the Cardinal de Foix, papal legate, renewed the lament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
that the canons of Valladolid remained unobserved, and in repeating
them it added a penalty of incarceration for pertinacious offenders,
indicating, moreover, one of the worst abuses to which the subject
gave rise, in forbidding all officials to take bribes from those who
transgressed the rules.<a id="FNanchor_778_778" href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">778</a> This effort was as fruitless as all previous
ones had been, and we shall see hereafter that the same state of
affairs continued until the sixteenth century was well advanced.</p>

GENERAL LEGISLATION.</h2>


<p>In a former section we have seen the efforts made by Calixtus II.
to enforce the received discipline of the church, and we have noted
the scanty measure of success which attended his labors. He apparently
himself recognized that they were futile, and that some action
of more decided character than had as yet been attempted was necessary
to accomplish the result so long and so energetically sought,
and so illusory to its ardent pursuers. On his return to Italy, and
his triumph over his unfortunate rival, the anti-pope Martin Burdino,
he summoned, in 1123, the first general council of the West, to confirm
the Concordat of Worms, which had just closed half a century
of strife between the papacy and the empire. Nearly a thousand
prelates obeyed his call, and that august assembly promulgated a
canon which not only forbade matrimony to those bound by vows
and holy orders, but commanded that if such marriages were contracted
they should be broken, and the parties to them subjected to
due penance.<a id="FNanchor_779_779" href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">779</a></p>

<p>This was a bold innovation. With the exception of a decretal of
Urban II. in 1090, to which little attention seems to have been paid,
we have seen that, previous to Calixtus, while the sacrament of marriage
was held incompatible with the ministry of the altar and with
the enjoyment of church property, it yet was respected and its binding
force was admitted, even to the point of rendering those who
assumed it unfitted for their sacred functions. At most, and as a
concession to a lax and irreligious generation, the option was allowed
of abandoning either the wife or the church. At Rheims, Calixtus
had deprived them of this choice, and had ordered their separation
from their wives. He now went a step further, and by the Lateran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
canon he declared the sacrament of marriage to be less potent than
the religious vow: the engagement with the church swallowed up
and destroyed all other ties. This gave the final seal to the separation
between the clergy and the laity, by declaring the priestly character
to be indelible. When once admitted to orders, he became a
being set apart from his fellows, consecrated to the service of God;
and the impassable gulf between him and the laity bound him forever
to the exclusive interests of the church. It is easy to perceive how
important an element this irrevocable nature of sacerdotalism became
in establishing and consolidating the ecclesiastical power.</p>

<p>The immensity of the change thus wrought in the practice, if not
in the doctrine, of the church can best be understood by comparing
the formal command thus issued to the Christian world with the
unqualified condemnation pronounced in earlier times against those
who attempted to dissolve marriage under religious pretexts.<a id="FNanchor_780_780" href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">780</a> And
in all ages the church has regarded the chastity of the monastic
orders as even more imperative than that of the secular clergy.</p>

<p>Revolutions never go backwards. Perhaps the Lateran fathers
who adopted the canon scarcely realized its logical conclusions.
If they did, they at all events shrank from expressing them openly
and fully, and left the faithful to draw their own deductions as to
the causes and consequences of such an order. Time, however,
familiarized the minds of ardent churchmen with the idea, and it was
seen that if the practice thus enjoined was correct, doctrine must be
made to suit and to justify it. To this end an additional stimulus
was afforded by the failure of the canon to accomplish the results
anticipated from it, for the custom of sacerdotal marriage was as yet
by no means eradicated. The council of Liége, held by Innocent
II. in 1131, referred to in a preceding section, and those of Clermont
and Rheims, over which he likewise presided, in 1130 and 1131,
show how little had been accomplished, and how generally the clergy
of Europe disregarded the restrictions nominally imposed upon them,
and the punishments which they so easily escaped.<a id="FNanchor_781_781" href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">781</a> In the canons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
of these councils not only is it observable that the question of marriage
and celibacy is treated as though it were a matter now for the
first time brought to the attention of the clergy, but also that the
innovation attempted by the council of Lateran, only seven or eight
years previous, is prudently suppressed and passed over without
even an allusion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Innocent, restored to Rome and to power, was bolder than when
wandering through Europe, soliciting the aid of the faithful. Surrounded
by a thousand bishops at the second great council of Lateran,
in 1139, he no longer dreaded to offend the susceptibilities of the
clergy, and he proceeded to justify the canon of 1123 by creating a
doctrine to suit the practice there enjoined. After repeating the
canons of Clermont and Rheims, he unhesitatingly pronounced that
a union contracted in opposition to the rule of the church was not a
marriage.<a id="FNanchor_782_782" href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">782</a> He draws no argument from the conflict of sacraments
assumed to be incompatible; a simple vow dissolves the sacrament
of marriage, and renders it null and void—or rather destroys its
efficacy and anticipates its existence.</p>

<p>The abounding wickedness of a perverse generation caused this
decree of the loftiest Christian tribunal to fall still-born and abortive
as its forerunners had done.<a id="FNanchor_783_783" href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">783</a> The church, however, was irrevocably
committed to the new doctrine and to all its consequences. When
Eugenius III. was driven out of Rome by Arnold of Brescia, he
presided, in 1148, over a council held at Rheims, where eleven
hundred bishops and abbots from Northern and Western Europe
assembled to do honor to the persecuted representative of St. Peter,
and to condemn the teachings of Gilbert de la Porrée. From this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
great assembly he procured the confirmation of the new dogma by
their adoption of the Lateran canon; while the repetition of that of
Clermont and Rheims (of 1130 and 1131) shows that the evil which
it was intended to repress still existed in full force.<a id="FNanchor_784_784" href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">784</a> The vague
assertion of Eugenius that he was but following in the footsteps of
the holy fathers, and a special reference to Innocent II. as his
authority, render it probable that the members of the council
demurred in committing themselves to the new principle, and that it
was only by showing that the matter was already decided under the
irrefragable authority of a general council that the consent of the
Transalpine churches was obtained.</p>

<p>St. Bernard himself, the impersonation of ascetic sacerdotalism,
hesitated to subscribe to the new dogma, and when the monks of
Chartres asked him to reconcile it with the teachings of Augustin
and Gregory the Great he candidly confessed that his dialectical skill
was unequal to the task.<a id="FNanchor_785_785" href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">785</a> So when an abbot applied to him for advice
in the case of one of his monks, who had left the convent and
married, St. Bernard stigmatized the act as highly improper, but
hesitated to pronounce it unlawful. He recommended that an attempt
be made to convince the parties that they were perilling their salvation,
and if this failed he thought that perhaps they might be separated
by episcopal authority.<a id="FNanchor_786_786" href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">786</a> In fact, four years after the council of
Rheims, St. Bernard reproached Eugenius with having caused the
adoption of canons which no one pretended to obey. If he thought
that they were enforced, he grievously erred; if he did not think so,
he had sinned either by decreeing what was not to be observed or in
neglecting to punish their non-observance—and no one was punished
for his disobedience.<a id="FNanchor_787_787" href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">787</a></p>

<p>Even in Rome itself the point was still disputed. At that very
time Gratian, the greatest canonist of the age, was engaged in the
compilation of his “Concordia discordantium Canonum,” a work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
undertaken at the request of the papal curia to restore to the canon
law the preëminence which it was fast losing in consequence of the
recently revived study of the Justinian jurisprudence. Published in
1151 under the auspices of Eugenius himself, and presented to the
world as the authoritative exposition of the laws and discipline of
the church, it was everywhere received with acclamation, and has
remained to this day the foundation of the canon law. Yet Gratian
himself, in this work without appeal, distinctly declares his opposition
to the doctrine of Innocent and Eugenius, asserting that a
deacon can lawfully marry if he chooses to abandon the ministry,
and that the sacrament of marriage is so potent that no antecedent
vow can render it void.<a id="FNanchor_788_788" href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">788</a></p>

<p>The new law was long in winning its way to general respect, nor
can it be a subject of wonder if those who disregarded the acknowledged
canons of the church by marrying in orders, or by permitting
such marriages in those under their charge, should neglect a rule of
recent origin and of more than doubtful propriety. The church,
however, was committed to it, and, moreover, could see in its eventual
recognition a more effectual means of accomplishing the long desired
object than in any expedient previously tried. By destroying all
such marriages, pronouncing them null and void, inflicting an ineffaceable
stigma on wife and offspring, subjecting the woman to the
certainty of being cast off without resource and without option on
the part of the husband, the position of the wife of an ecclesiastic
would become most unenviable; her kindred would prevent her from
exposing herself to such calamities, and no priest could succeed in
finding a consort above the lowest class, whose union with him would
expose him to the contempt of his flock.</p>

<p>How slender was the immediate result of the efforts of Innocent
and Eugenius, however, is manifested by the allusions of Geroch,
Provost of Reichersperg, who, writing about the middle of the cen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>tury,
complains that any one who would shun intercourse with
Nicolitan and simoniacal heretics must quit the world, for it was full
of them, and he maintains the propriety of calling them heretics
because they openly defended and justified their evil courses.<a id="FNanchor_789_789" href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">789</a>
Indeed, so shamelessly were their transgressions displayed, that the
faithful were sometimes scandalized by the sight of the priests’ wives
assisting their husbands in the ministry of the altar;<a id="FNanchor_790_790" href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">790</a> while conventual
discipline had sunk so low that nuns were in the habit of
deferring their formal vows until the lassitude of old age should
render the restraints thereby assumed easy to be endured,<a id="FNanchor_791_791" href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">791</a> and
canons led a life which was only distinguishable from that of the
laity by its shamelessness.<a id="FNanchor_792_792" href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">792</a> Nor was this confined to Germany. In
France, Hugh, Archbishop of Rouen, complains that those who
married in orders openly defended their evil practices and quoted
Scripture to sustain themselves.<a id="FNanchor_793_793" href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">793</a></p>

<p>In England, as seen in a preceding section, the new theory of
Innocent and Eugenius remained a dead letter. Indeed, as late as
1470 Sir John Fortescue incidentally alludes to a recent case in
which a priest named John Fringe, who had lived in orders for three
years, procured two false witnesses to swear that he had previously
been betrothed to a certain maiden, and this preliminary promise of
marriage was held by court to supersede his priestly ordination; he
was ejected from the priesthood and compelled to marry the girl, with
whom he lived fourteen years, until he was executed for treason
by the Lancastrians during the wars of the Roses.<a id="FNanchor_794_794" href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">794</a> In Spain, as
we have already seen, priestly marriage was forbidden by the secular
law as late as the latter half of the thirteenth century, and priests in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
consequence were wont to protect their partners by entering into
the most solemn compacts, the customary employment of which
shows that they must have been habitually enforced by the municipal
tribunals regardless of the censures of the church.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The long pontificate of Alexander III., extending from 1159 to
1181, was absorbed for the most part by his deadly strife with Frederic
Barbarossa. Yet, even before he was released from that ever-present
danger, he found leisure to urge the cause of sacerdotal
celibacy; and after the humiliation of his mortal enemy he devoted
himself to it with a zeal which earned for him among his contemporaries
the credit of establishing its observance.<a id="FNanchor_795_795" href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">795</a> He who, as the
legate Roland, had nearly paid, under the avenging sword of Otho
of Wittelsbach, the forfeit of his life for his rude boldness at the
imperial court, was little likely to abate one jot of the claims which
the church asserted on the obedience of layman and clerk; and he
recognized too fully the potency of the canons of Lateran and
Rheims not to insist upon their observance. The very necessity under
which he found himself, however, of repeating those canons shows
how utterly neglected they had been, and how successfully the clergy
had thus far resisted their reception and acknowledgment. Thus
when, in 1163, he held the council of Tours, he was obliged to content
himself with a canon which allowed three warnings to those
who publicly kept concubines, and it was only after neglect of these
warnings that they were threatened with deprivation of functions
and benefice;<a id="FNanchor_796_796" href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">796</a> and when, in 1172, his legates presided over the
council of Avranches, which absolved Henry II. for the murder of
A’Becket, the Norman clergy were emphatically reminded that those
who married in holy orders must put away their wives, and this in
terms which indicate that the rule had not been previously obeyed.<a id="FNanchor_797_797" href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">797</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
Yet notwithstanding this formal declaration, only a few years later
we find the Archbishop of Rheims applying to him for counsel in
the case of a deacon who had committed matrimony, to which Alexander
of course replied that the marriage was no marriage, and that
the offending ecclesiastic must be separated from the woman, and
undergo due penance.<a id="FNanchor_798_798" href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">798</a> The persistence of the pope, and the necessity
of his urgency, are farther shown by sundry epistles to various
English bishops, in which the rule is enunciated as absolute and unvarying;<a id="FNanchor_799_799" href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">799</a>
and he takes occasion to stigmatize such marriages with
the most degrading epithet, when he graciously pardons those concerned,
and permits their restitution after a long course of penitence,
on their giving evidence of a reformed life.<a id="FNanchor_800_800" href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">800</a></p>

<p>Yet even Alexander was forced to abate somewhat of his stern
determination, in consideration of the incorrigible perversity of the
time, though he seems not to have remarked that he abandoned the
principle by admitting exceptions, and that the reasons assigned in
such individual cases might, with equal cogency, be applied to the
total withdrawal of the rule. When the Calabrian bishops informed
him that clerks in holy orders throughout their dioceses committed
matrimony, he ordered that priests and deacons should be irrevocably
separated from their wives; but, in the case of subdeacons of doubtful
morals, he instructed the prelates that they should tacitly connive at
the irregularity, lest in place of one woman, many should be abused,
and a greater evil be incurred, in the endeavor to avoid a less.<a id="FNanchor_801_801" href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">801</a> This
worldly wisdom also dictated his orders to the Bishop of Exeter, in
whose diocese subdeacons were in the habit of openly marrying. He
directs an examination into the lives and characters of the offenders;
those whose regular habits and staid morality afford fair expectation
of their chastity in celibacy are to be forcibly separated from their
wives; while those whose disorderly character renders probable their
general licentiousness if condemned to a single life are not to be disturbed—taking
care, however, that they do not minister at the altar,
or receive ecclesiastical benifices.<a id="FNanchor_802_802" href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">802</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span></p>

<p>Alexander adopted the principle that a simple vow of chastity did
not prevent marriage or render it null, but that a formal vow, or the
reception of orders, created a dissolution of marriage, or a total inability
to enter into it;<a id="FNanchor_803_803" href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">803</a> but Celestin III. carried the principle still
farther, and decreed that a simple vow, while it did not dissolve an
existing connection, was sufficient to prevent a future one.<a id="FNanchor_804_804" href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">804</a></p>

<p>Alexander did not confine himself to this portion of the question,
but with ceaseless activity labored to enforce the observance of celibacy
in general, and to repress the immorality which disgraced the
church throughout Christendom—immorality which led Alain de
l’Isle, the “Universal Doctor,” to characterize the ecclesiastics of
his time as being old men in their inefficiency and young men in
their unbridled passions.<a id="FNanchor_805_805" href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">805</a> Alexander’s efforts were particularly
directed to put an end to the practice of hereditary priesthood, and
its constant consequence, hereditary benefices. If I have made little
allusion to this subject during the century under consideration, it is
not that the church had relaxed her exertions to place some limit on
this apparently incurable disorder, or that the passive resistance to
her efforts had been less successful than we have seen it on previous
occasions. The perpetual injunctions of Alexander show at once
the universality of the vice, and the determination of the pontiff to
eradicate it. At the same time it became a frequent, and no doubt
a profitable portion of the duties of the papal chancery, to grant
special dispensations when those who held such preferment, or who
desired to retain their wives, underwent the dangers and expense of
a journey to Rome, and were rewarded for their confidence in the
benignity of the Holy Father by a rescript to their bishops, commanding
their reinstatement in the benefices from which they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
been ejected.<a id="FNanchor_806_806" href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">806</a> The power to grant such dispensations was shrewdly
reserved as the exclusive privilege of the papal court;<a id="FNanchor_807_807" href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">807</a> and a high
churchman of the period assures us that there was no difficulty in
obtaining them.<a id="FNanchor_808_808" href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">808</a> It need not, therefore, surprise us that Alexander’s
successor, Lucius III., found the hereditary transmission of the
priestly office claimed as an absolute right.<a id="FNanchor_809_809" href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">809</a> And not only did the
claims of the papal chancery thus interfere with the execution of the
law by its power of granting dispensations, but its appellate jurisdiction
was constantly used to avert punishment from the worst offenders.
Thus Lucius III., about the year 1181 was obliged to grant
to Maurice de Sully, Bishop of Paris, the right to dispossess of their
benefices and functions, without appeal, certain notorious concubinarians
who, on being threatened with the application of the law,
had defied him by interposing an appeal to Rome.<a id="FNanchor_810_810" href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">810</a> This centralization
of all power in the papal court, and the unblushing venality of
the Roman officials, meet us in every age as the efficient obstacle to
the efforts of reforming prelates throughout Europe.</p>

<p>The uncertainty of this conflicting legislation, at times enforced,
and at times dispensed with by the supreme power, led to innumerable
complications and endless perplexity in private life. Indeed, a
large portion of the canons are founded on responses given by the
popes to settle cases of peculiar difficulty arising from ignorance or
neglect of the discipline enjoined, and many of these reveal extreme
hardship inflicted on those who could be convicted of no intentional
guilt. Perhaps the most noteworthy instance of the troubles caused
by the new regulations was that of Bossaert d’Avesnes, which resulted
in a desperate war to determine the possession of the rich provinces
of Flanders and Hainault. As it illustrates the doubts which still
environed these particular points, and the conflicting decisions to
which they were liable, even from the infallibility of successive popes,
it may be worth briefly sketching here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span></p>

<p>When Baldwin of Flanders, Emperor of Constantinople, died in
1206, his eldest daughter Jane succeeded to his territories of Flanders
and Hainault, while his second child, Margaret, was placed under the
guardianship of Bossaert d’Avesnes. Bossaert was a relative of her
mother, Mary of Champagne, and though he held the comparatively
insignificant position of chantre of Tournay, he was yet a man of
great repute and influence. With the assent and approbation of the
estates of Flanders, Margaret and Bossaert were married, the issue
of the union being three sons. Whether the fact of his having
received the subdiaconate was publicly known or not is somewhat
doubtful; but he seems at length to have been awakened to a sense
of his uncertain position, when he went to Rome for the purpose of
obtaining a dispensation and legitimating his children. Innocent III.
not only refused the application, but commanded him to restore
Margaret to her relatives and to do penance by a pilgrimage to the
Holy Land. Disregarding these injunctions, he lived openly with
his wife after his return and was excommunicated in consequence.
At length Margaret left him and married Guillaume de Dampierre,
while Bossaert was assassinated during a second visit to Rome,
where he was seeking reconciliation to the church. When at last,
in 1244, the Countess Jane closed her long and weary career by
assuming the veil at Marquette, without leaving heirs, the children
of Margaret by both marriages claimed the succession, and Margaret
favored the younger, asserting, without scruple, that her elder sons
were illegitimate. The difficult question was referred to St. Louis
for arbitration, and in 1247 the good king assigned Flanders to
Gui de Dampierre and Hainault to Jean d’Avesnes, thus recognizing
both marriages as legitimate. This, of course, satisfied neither party.
Innocent IV. was appealed to, and in 1248 he sent commissioners to
investigate the knotty affair. They reported that the marriage of
Bossaert had been contracted in the face of all Flanders, and that
the d’Avesnes were legitimate, which judgment was confirmed by
Innocent himself in 1252. Thus fortified, Jean d’Avesnes resisted
the proposed partition, and a bloody civil war arose. The victory
of Vacheren placed the Dampierre in the hands of their half-brothers,
and promised to be decisive, until Margaret called in Charles de
Valois, bribing him with the offer of Hainault to complete the disinheriting
of her first-born. The war continued until Louis, re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>turning
from the East in 1255, compelled the combatants to lay down
their arms, and to abide by his arbitration.<a id="FNanchor_811_811" href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">811</a></p>

<p>In this case we see Innocent III. deciding that marriage was incompatible
with the subdiaconate. Yet it is a striking illustration
of the uncertainty which still surrounded the matter to find the same
pope, in 1208, commanding a subdeacon of Laon to return to the
wife whom he had abandoned on taking orders, and to treat her in
all respects as a wife. Innocent is not to be suspected of any temporizing
concession to prevailing laxity, and yet in this case he
overruled the uninterrupted tradition of the canons that married
men taking orders should thenceforth treat their wives as sisters;
and the doubts which experienced ecclesiastics entertained with
regard to the law are visible in the fact that when the wife complained
of her abandonment to the metropolitan authorities at
Rheims they did not pretend to give judgment, but sent the testimony
in the case at once to Innocent for his decision.<a id="FNanchor_812_812" href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">812</a></p>

<p>Another curious case occurring about the same time illustrates the
complexity of the questions which arose and the manner in which
the selfishness of ascetic zeal sometimes eluded even the very slender
barriers with which the church limited its gratification. As we have
seen, it was an ancient rule that no man could assume monastic
vows without the assent of his wife, with the additional condition
that she must at the same time enter a nunnery. It appears
that a husband desiring to become a monk, and finding his
wife obstinately opposed to his designs, enlisted the services of
various priests to influence her, carefully concealing from her the
obligation which her assent would impose upon her to take the veil.
Still she obstinately refused, until at last he threatened to castrate
himself, when she yielded and went through the ceremony of placing
with her own hands his head on the altar. The wife thus abandoned
took to evil courses, and the husband-monk applied in person to
Innocent III. to learn whether he ought to remain in his order,
seeing that his continence might be responsible for her unchastity.
In spite of the deceit practised upon the wife, Innocent resolved his
doubts in favor of the maintenance of his vows, giving as a reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
that her adulteries deprived her of claim on him. At the same time,
nothing was said as to compelling the woman to take the veil.<a id="FNanchor_813_813" href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">813</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In view of these perplexities, it is no wonder that even the resolute
spirit of Alexander III., dismayed at the arduous nature of the
struggle, or appalled at the ineradicable vices which defied even
papal authority, at times shrank from the contest and was ready to
abandon the principle. If we may believe Giraldus Cambrensis,
who, as a contemporary intimately connected with the highest
ecclesiastical authorities in England, was not likely to be mistaken,
and whose long sojourn at the court of Innocent III. would have
afforded him ample opportunities of correcting a misstatement,
Alexander had once resolved to introduce the discipline of the Greek
church in Western Europe, permitting single marriages with virgins.
To this he had obtained the assent of his whole court, except his
chancellor Albert, who was afterwards pope under the name of
Gregory VIII. The resistance of this dignitary was so powerful
as to cause the abandonment of the project.<a id="FNanchor_814_814" href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">814</a> Alexander, indeed,
was not alone in this conviction. Giraldus himself was fully convinced
that such a change would be most useful to the church,
though as archdeacon of St. David’s he had displayed his zeal for
the enforcement of the canon by measures too energetic for the degeneracy
of the age, and though he occupies, in his “Gemma Ecclesiastica,”
twenty-one chapters with an exhortation to his clergy to
abandon their evil courses.<a id="FNanchor_815_815" href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">815</a> Men of high character did not hesitate
to take even stronger ground against the rule. The celebrated Peter
Comestor, whose orthodoxy is unquestioned, taught publicly in his
lectures that the devil had never inflicted so severe a blow on the
church as in procuring the adoption of celibacy.<a id="FNanchor_816_816" href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">816</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span></p>

<p>These were but individual opinions. The policy of the church
remained unaltered, and Alexander’s successors emulated his example
in endeavoring to enforce the canons. Clement III. took advantage
of the profound impression which the capture of Jerusalem by Saladin
(Oct. 1187) produced on all Europe, when the fall of the Latin
kingdom was attributed to the sins of Christendom. He preached a
general reformation. Abstinence from meat on Wednesdays and
Saturdays for five years, and various other kinds of mortification
were enjoined on all, to propitiate a justly offended Deity, but the
clergy were the objects of special reproof. Their extreme laxity of
morals, their neglect of the dress of their order, their worldly ambition
and pursuits, drinking, gambling, and flocking to tournaments,
and the unclerical deportment which left little difference between
them and the laity, were some of the accusations brought against
them. To their incontinence, however, was chiefly attributed the
wrath of God, besides the measureless scandals to which their
conduct exposed the church, and they were commanded to remove
all suspected females from their houses within forty days, under pain
of suspension from their functions and revenues.<a id="FNanchor_817_817" href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">817</a> That these rebukes
were not the mere angry declamation of an ascetic is shown by the
declaration of Celestin III., a few years later, that throughout
Germany the custom still prevailed of fathers substituting in their
benefices their sons, born during priesthood, so that frequently
parent and offspring ministered together in the same church;<a id="FNanchor_818_818" href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">818</a> and
the extent of the demoralization is evident when we find the sons of
priests and deacons alluded to as a class ineligible to knighthood in
a constitution of Frederic Barbarossa in 1187.<a id="FNanchor_819_819" href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">819</a> The regular clergy
offered no exception to the general relaxation of discipline. In 1192
Odo, Bishop of Toul, felt himself forced to deplore the wickedness of
monks who left their monasteries and publicly took to themselves
wives, but he could devise no better means of arresting the scandal
than excommunicating them and their growing families.<a id="FNanchor_820_820" href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">820</a></p>

<p>Yet, with all his ardor, Clement admitted that celibacy was only
a local rule of discipline, and that there was nothing really in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>compatible
between marriage and the holy functions of the altar.
The time had not yet come when the council of Trent could
erect the inviolable continence of the priesthood into an article
of faith, and Clement was willing to allow that priests of the
Greek church, under his jurisdiction, could legitimately be married
and could celebrate mass while their families were increasing around
them.<a id="FNanchor_821_821" href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">821</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Innocent III., who, by the fortunate conjunction of the time in
which he flourished with his own matchless force of character, enjoyed
perhaps the culmination of papal power and prerogative, at
length brought to the struggle an influence and a determination
which could scarcely fail to prove decisive on any question capable
of a favorable solution. By his decretals and his legates he labored
assiduously to enforce obedience to the canons, and when, in 1215,
he summoned the whole Christian world to meet in the fourth council
of Lateran, that august assembly of about thirteen hundred prelates,
acting under his impulsion, and reflecting his triumph over John of
England and Otho of Germany, spoke with an authority which no
former body since that of Nicæa had possessed. Its canons on the
subject before us were simple, perhaps less violent in their tone than
those of former synods, but they breathed the air of conscious
strength, and there was no man that dared openly to gainsay them.
A more rigid observance of the rules was enjoined, and any one
officiating while suspended for contravention was punishable with
perpetual degradation and deprivation of his emoluments. Yet the
rule was admitted to be merely a local ordinance peculiar to the
Latin church, for, in the effort made by the council to heal the
schism with Constantinople, the right of the East to permit the
marriage of its priests was acknowledged by a clause visiting with
severer penalties those who by custom were allowed to marry, and
who, notwithstanding this license, still permitted themselves illicit
indulgences. The disgraceful traffic by which in some places prelates
regularly sold permissions to sin was denounced in the strongest
terms, as a vice equal in degree to that which it encouraged;
and the common custom of fathers obtaining preferment in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
own churches for their illegitimate offspring was reprobated as it
deserved.<a id="FNanchor_822_822" href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">822</a></p>

<p>There is nothing novel in these canons, nor can they in strictness
be said to constitute an epoch in the history of sacerdotal celibacy.
They enunciate no new principles, they threaten no new punishments,
yet are they noteworthy as marking the settled policy of the church
at a period when it had acquired that plenitude of power and vigor
of organization which insured at least an outward show of obedience
to its commands. The successive labors of so long a series of pontiffs,
during more than a century and a half, carrying with them the
cumulative authority of Rome, had gradually broken down resistance,
and the Lateran canons were the definitive expression of its discipline
on this subject. Accordingly, though we shall see how little was
accomplished in securing the purity of the priesthood, which was the
ostensible object of the rule, yet hereafter there are to be found few
traces of marriage in holy orders, except in the distant countries to
which reference has already been made.</p>

<p>Yet the readiness to relax the rule when a substantial advantage
was to be gained still continued, and when the effort, commenced at
the council of Lyons in 1274, to reunite the Greek church under the
supremacy of the Holy See was apparently successful, Nicholas III.
stoutly insisted upon the addition of “<i>filioque</i>” to the Symbol, but
was discreetly silent as to separating the wives of priests from their
husbands, promising in general terms that in all that merely concerned
ritual observances the way should be made easy for them.<a id="FNanchor_823_823" href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">823</a></p>

<p>In Southern Italy, when the churches were actually brought
together under the domination of Rome, priests of Greek origin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
were allowed to retain their wives, but married clerks of Latin
parentage were not permitted to enter holy orders without separation.
It not infrequently happened that the latter endeavored to elude the
prohibition by getting themselves ordained in the Greek church, and
it became necessary to denounce severe penalties not only against
them, but against the prelates who permitted it.<a id="FNanchor_824_824" href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">824</a></p>

RESULTS.</h2>


<p>The unrelaxing efforts of two centuries had at length achieved an
inevitable triumph. One by one the different churches of Latin
Christendom yielded to the fiat of the successor of St. Peter, and
their ecclesiastics were forced to forego the privilege of assuming
the most sacred of earthly ties with the sanction of heaven and the
approbation of man. Sacerdotalism vindicated its claim to exclusive
obedience; the church successfully asserted its right to command
the entire life of its members, and to sunder all the bonds that might
allure them to render a divided allegiance. In theory, at least, all
who professed a religious life or assumed the sacred ministry were
given up wholly to the awful service which they had undertaken:
no selfishly personal aspirations could divert their energies from the
aggrandizement of their class, nor were the temporal possessions of
the establishment to be exposed to the minute but all-pervading
dilapidation of the wife and family.</p>

<p>If these were the objects of the movement inaugurated by Damiani
and Hildebrand, and followed up with such unrelenting vigor by
Calixtus and Alexander and Innocent, the history of the mediæval
church attests how fully they were attained. It is somewhat instructive,
indeed, to observe that in the rise of the papal power to its
culmination under Innocent III. it was precisely the pontiffs most
conspicuous for their enforcement of the rule of celibacy who were
likewise most prominent in their assertion of the supremacy, temporal
and spiritual, of the head of the Roman church. Whether or
not they recognized and acknowledged the connection, they labored
as though the end in view was clearly appreciated, and their triumphs
on the one field were sure to be followed by corresponding successes
on the other.</p>

<p>Yet in all this the ostensible object was always represented to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
the purity of the church and of its ministers. The other advantages
were either systematically ignored or but casually alluded to. One
warning voice, indeed, was raised, in a quarter where it would have
at least commanded respectful attention, had not the church appeared
to imagine itself superior to the ordinary laws of cause and effect.
While Innocent II. was laboring to enforce his new doctrine that
ordination and religious vows were destructive of marriage, St.
Bernard, the ascetic reformer of monachism and the foremost ecclesiastic
of his day, was thundering against the revival of Manichæism.
The heresies of the Albigenses respecting marriage were to be combated,
and, in performing this duty, he pointed out with startling
vigor the evils to the church and to mankind of the attempt to enforce
a purity incompatible with human nature. Deprive the church of
honorable marriage, he exclaimed, and you fill her with concubinage,
incest, and all manner of nameless vice and uncleanness.<a id="FNanchor_825_825" href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">825</a> It was
still an age of faith; and while earnest men like St. Bernard could
readily anticipate the evils attendant upon the asceticism of heretics,
they could yet persuade themselves, as the Council of Trent subsequently
expressed it, that God would not deny the gift of chastity to
those who rightly sought it in the bosom of the true church—though
St. Bernard himself confessed that crimes which he dared not even
to name commonly followed after the fornication, adultery, and incest
which specially characterized innumerable ministers of Christ.<a id="FNanchor_826_826" href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">826</a> It
remains for us to see what was the success of the attempt thus
deliberately to tempt the Lord.</p>

<p>It is somewhat significant that when, in France, the rule of celibacy
was completely restored, strict churchmen should have found it necessary
also to revive the hideously suggestive restriction which denied
to the priest the society of his mother or of his sister. Even in the
profoundest barbarism of the tenth century, or the unbridled license
of the eleventh; even when Damiani descanted upon the disorders of
his contemporaries with all the cynicism of the most exalted asceticism,
horrors such as these are not alluded to. It is reserved for the advancement
of the thirteenth century and the enforcement of celibacy
to show us how outraged human nature may revenge itself and protest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
against the shackles imposed by zealous sacerdotalism or unreasoning
bigotry. In 1208, Cardinal Guala, Innocent’s legate in France,
issued an order in which he not only repeated the threadbare prohibitions
respecting focariæ and concubines, but commanded that
even mothers and other relatives should not be allowed to reside
with men in holy orders, the devil being the convenient personage on
whom, as usual, was thrown the responsibility of the scandals which
were known to occur frequently under such circumstances.<a id="FNanchor_827_827" href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">827</a> That
this decree was not allowed to pass into speedy oblivion is shown by a
reference to it as still well known and in force a century later, in the
statutes of the church of Tréguier.<a id="FNanchor_828_828" href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">828</a> And that the necessity for it
was not evanescent may be assumed from its repetition in the regulations
of the see of Nismes, the date of which is uncertain, but
probably attributable to the close of the fourteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_829_829" href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">829</a> At the
same time, we have evidence that Cardinal Guala’s efforts were productive
of little effect. Four years later, in 1212, we find Innocent
formally authorizing the prelates of France mercifully to pardon
those who had been excommunicated under Guala’s rules, with the
suggestive proviso that the power thus conferred was not to be used
for the purpose of extorting unhallowed gains.<a id="FNanchor_830_830" href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">830</a> Still more significant
is the fact that in the same year Innocent dispatched another legate,
Cardinal Robert, duly commissioned to renew the endless task of
purifying the Gallican church. Guala’s efforts would seem to have
already passed into oblivion, for in a council which Cardinal Robert
held in Paris, he gravely promulgated a canon forbidding the priesthood
from keeping their concubines so openly as to give rise to
scandal, and threatening the recalcitrants with excommunication if
they should persist in retaining their improper consorts for forty
days after receiving notice.<a id="FNanchor_831_831" href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">831</a> That monachism was no less productive
of sin in the depraved moral atmosphere of the age is rendered
evident by other canons of the same council, which prohibit both
monks and nuns from sleeping two in a bed, with the avowed object<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
of repressing crimes against nature.<a id="FNanchor_832_832" href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">832</a> It may well be asked what
was the value of the continence aimed at in monastic vows when the
whole body of the monastic orders was the subject of such degrading
regulations as these.</p>

<p>The clergy of France were not exceptional, and, unfortunately,
there can be no denial of the fact that notorious and undisguised
illicit unions, or still more debasing secret licentiousness, was a universal
and pervading vice of the church throughout Christendom.
Its traces amid all the ecclesiastical legislation of the thirteenth,
fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries are too broad and deep to be
called into question, and if no evidence remained except the constant
and unavailing efforts to repress it, that alone would be sufficient.
National and local synods, pastoral epistles, statutes of churches, all
the records of ecclesiastical discipline are full of it. Now deploring
and now threatening, exhausting ingenuity in devising new regulations
and more effective punishments, the prelates of those ages found
themselves involved in a task as endless and as bootless as that of
the Danaidæ. Occasionally, indeed, it is lost sight of momentarily,
when the exactions and usurpations of the laity, or the gradual
extension of secular jurisdiction monopolized the attention of those
who were bound to defend the privileges of their class; but, with
these rare exceptions, it may be asserted as a general truth that
scarcely a synod met, or a body of laws was drawn up to govern
some local church, in which the subject did not receive a prominent
position and careful consideration. It would be wearisome and unprofitable
to recapitulate here the details of this fruitless iteration.
Without by any means exhausting the almost limitless materials for
investigation, I have collected a formidable mass of references upon
the subject, but an examination of them shows so little of novelty
and so constant a recurrence to the starting-point, that no new principles
can be evolved from them, and their only interest lies in their
universality, and in demonstrating how resultless was the unceasing
effort to remove the uneffaceable plague-spot.</p>

<p>Spasmodic efforts, it is true, occasionally wrought a temporary improvement,
as when Alexander IV., in 1259, proclaimed to the world
that licentious ecclesiastics were the cause of all the evils under
which the church was groaning, for through them the name of God
was blasphemed throughout the world, the sacraments were polluted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
the Catholic religion lost the reverence of the faithful, the people
were deprived of the benefits of divine service, the substance of the
church was dissipated, the Word of God was defiled by their impure
lips, heretics were encouraged in their opposition, oppressors were
emboldened to persecution, and the sacrilegious were able to expose
the whole church to mockery and contempt. To alleviate these
troubles, he not only ordered the prelates of Christendom to prosecute
all offences of this nature with the utmost severity, but, recognizing
his own court as an obstacle to reform, he surrendered his
appellate jurisdiction in such cases, and forbade all appeals to Rome.<a id="FNanchor_833_833" href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">833</a>
His earnestness bore some fruit, and many prelates were stimulated
to reform their flocks, causing large numbers of ecclesiastics to be
expelled. A contemporary rhymester, Adam de la Halle (better
known perhaps as Le Bossu d’Arras), thus alludes to the effects of
the Bull:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Et chascuns le pape encosa</div>
  <div class="verse">Quant tant de bons clers desposa.—</div>
  <div class="verse">—Romme a bien le tierche partie</div>
  <div class="verse">Des clers fais sers et amatis.”<a id="FNanchor_834_834" href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">834</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="pnind">As in all similar attempts, however, the results were but transitory.
Ferry, Bishop of Orleans, would scarce have been murdered, in
1299, by a knight whose daughter he had seduced, had the father
felt that there was any chance of punishing the criminal by having
the canons enforced against him.<a id="FNanchor_835_835" href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">835</a></p>

<p>In the confessed nullity of penal legislation it was natural for the
church to have recourse to her supernatural armory, and accordingly
we have ample store of legends framed with the hope of frightening
by spiritual terrors those who were indurated to canon and decretal.
The dead concubine of a priest was seen chased by infernal demons,
and a knight who sought to protect her had a handful of hair left in
his grasp by her mad terror; and the reality of the awful scene was
verified on opening her tomb and finding her tresses deficient. So
a nun who had yielded to temptation and had sought to conceal her
frailty by murdering her child, dying unconfessed, was seen wandering
hopelessly with a burning infant clasped to her bosom, which she
proclaimed was to be her torment throughout eternity.<a id="FNanchor_836_836" href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">836</a> It is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
wonder that the well-meant ingenuity which devised these tales met
with slender reward, and that the threat of post-mortem punishment
was as powerless as that of temporal penalties, for these tales were
counterbalanced by other superstitions, such as that which taught
that the most sinful, even among laymen, could obtain eternal salvation
by the simple expedient of enveloping himself in a monastic
habit on his death-bed. The Benedictines had well-authenticated
cases in plenty where the most vicious of men, by adopting this
plan, were rescued by St. Benedict himself from the hands of
demons conducting them to eternal punishment, in spite of Satan’s
complaints that he was defrauded of his rights.<a id="FNanchor_837_837" href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">837</a> The Franciscans
contended with the Benedictines as to the efficacy of their respective
patrons, and related with pride that St. Francis visited purgatory
every year and carried with him to heaven the souls of his followers—a
general plan of salvation which gave his vestments a decided
superiority over those of the older order. As the practice became
more common, it was recognized as equally dangerous to the welfare
of the faithful and to the revenues of the church, and was condemned
as a pernicious error.<a id="FNanchor_838_838" href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">838</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So open and avowed was the shame of the church that the
Neapolitan code, promulgated about 1231 by the enlightened Frederic
II., absolutely interfered to give a quasi legitimacy to the children
of ecclesiastics, and removed, to a certain extent, their disability of
inheritance. The imperial officials were ordered to assign appropriate
shares in parental estates to such children, notwithstanding
their illegitimacy, conditioned on the payment of an annual tax to
the imperial court; and parents were not allowed to alienate their
property to the prejudice of such children, any more than in cases
of the offspring of lawful wedlock.<a id="FNanchor_839_839" href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">839</a> The numbers and influence of
the class thus protected must indeed have been great to induce such
interference in their favor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span></p>

<p>We have already seen ecclesiastical authority for the assertion
that in the Spanish Peninsula the children sprung from such illicit
connections rivalled in numbers the offspring of the laity. That they
were numerous elsewhere may be presumed when we see Innocent
IV., in 1248, forced to grant to the province of Livonia the privilege
of having them eligible to holy orders, except when born of parents
involved in monastic vows,<a id="FNanchor_840_840" href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">840</a> for necessity alone could excuse so flagrant
a departure from the canons enunciated during the preceding
two centuries. A similar conclusion is deducible from the fact that
in the municipal code in force throughout Northern Germany during
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, they were deemed of sufficient
importance to be entitled to a separate place in the classification of
wer-gilds, or blood-moneys; while the aim of the lawgiver to stigmatize
them is manifested by his placing them below the peasant, deeming
them superior only to the juggler;<a id="FNanchor_841_841" href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">841</a> and that this was not a
provision of transient force is clear from the commentary upon it in
a body of law dating from the end of the fourteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_842_842" href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">842</a> Nor
is the evidence less convincing which may be drawn from the use of
the old German word <i>pfaffenkind</i>, or priest’s son, which became generally
used as equivalent to bastard.<a id="FNanchor_843_843" href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">843</a> It would not, indeed, be difficult
to understand the numbers of this class of the population if
ecclesiastics in general followed the example of Henry III., Bishop
of Liége, whose natural children amounted to no less than sixty-five.<a id="FNanchor_844_844" href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">844</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span></p>

<p>The direct encouragement thus given to illicit connections, by providing
for the children sprung from them, neutralized one of the
principal modes by which the church endeavored to suppress them.
The innumerable canons issued during this period, forbidding and
pronouncing null and void all testamentary provisions in favor of
concubines and descendants, prove not only how much stress was
laid upon this as an efficient means of repression, but also how little
endeavor was made by the guilty parties to conceal their sin. As
all testaments came within the sphere of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, it
would seem that there should have been no difficulty in enforcing
regulations of this kind, yet their constant repetition proves either
that those who were intrusted with their execution were habitually
remiss, or else that the popular feelings were in favor of the unfortunates,
and interfered with the efficacy of the laws.</p>

<p>A single instance, out of many that might be cited, will illustrate
this. In 1225 the Cardinal-legate Conrad held, at Mainz, a national
council of the German empire, of which one of the canons declared
that, in order to abolish the custom of ecclesiastics leaving to their
concubines and children the fruits of their benefices, not only should
such legacies be void, but those guilty of the attempt should lie
unburied, all who endeavored to enforce such testaments should be
anathematized, and the church where it was permitted should lie
under an interdict as long as the wrong was permitted.<a id="FNanchor_845_845" href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">845</a> The terrible
rigor of these provisions shows how deep seated was the evil aimed
at; nor were they uncalled for when we see a will, executed in 1218
by no less a personage than Gotfrid, Archdeacon of Wurzburg, in
which he leaves legacies to the children whom he confesses to have
been born in sin, and of whom he expects his relatives to take charge.<a id="FNanchor_846_846" href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">846</a>
Had any earnest attempt been made to enforce the canons of the
Legate, they would have been amply sufficient to eradicate the evil;
yet their utter inefficiency is demonstrated by the council of Fritzlar
in 1246, and that of Cologne in 1260. The former of these was
held by the Archbishop of Mainz; it has no canons directed against
concubinage, which was as public as ever, but it deplores the dilapidation
of the temporalities of the church by the testamentary pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>visions
of priests in favor of their guilty partners and children, and
it repeats, with additional emphasis, the regulations of 1225.<a id="FNanchor_847_847" href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">847</a> The
latter renews the complaint that priests not only continue their evil
courses throughout life, but are not ashamed, on their death-beds,
to leave to their children the patrimony of Christ; and another provision
is equally significant in forbidding priests to be present at the
marriages of their children, or that such marriages should be solemnized
with pomp and ostentation.<a id="FNanchor_848_848" href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">848</a> The following year another
council, held at Mainz, repeated the prohibition as to the diversion
of church property to the consorts and natural children of priests;<a id="FNanchor_849_849" href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">849</a>
while that regarding the solemnization of their children’s marriages
was renewed by the synod of Olmutz in 1342.<a id="FNanchor_850_850" href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">850</a> In 1416 the synod
of Breslau deplored that the old canons were forgotten and despised,
and that priests were not ashamed to bequeath to their bastards accumulations
of property which would form fit portions for lofty nobles.<a id="FNanchor_851_851" href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">851</a>
How thoroughly in fact it was deemed a matter of course for the
children of ecclesiastics to marry well and to have good dowries, is
to be seen in Chaucer’s description of the wife of “deinous Simekin”,
the proud miller of Trompington:——</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“A wif he hadde, comen of noble kin;</div>
  <div class="verse">The person of the toun hire father was.</div>
  <div class="verse">With hire he yaf ful many a panne of bras,</div>
  <div class="verse">For that Simkin shuld in his blood allie.</div>
  <div class="verse">She was yfostered in a nonnerie.” (The Reves Tale.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>As time wore on, and the clergy, despite the innumerable admonitions
and threats which were everywhere showered upon them,
persisted in retaining their female companions, they appear, in some
places, to have gradually assumed the privilege as a matter of right;
and, what is even more remarkable, they seem to have had a certain
measure of success in the assumption. In 1284 the Papal Legate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
Gerard Bishop of Sabina, at the Council of Amalfi, renewed and
strengthened the decretals of Alexander III. respecting the concubinary
priests of the Neapolitan provinces, ordering the ejection of all
who should not separate from their partners within a month, suspending
all prelates who should neglect to enforce the rule, and fining
heavily those who, as in so many other places, made the frailties of
their subordinates a source of filthy gain.<a id="FNanchor_852_852" href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">852</a> The severity of these
provisions was as unsuccessful as usual, and at length the secular
power endeavored to come to the assistance of the ecclesiastical
authorities. The pious Charles the Lame of Naples, whose close
alliance with Rome rendered him eager in everything that would
gratify the head of the church, about the year 1300 imposed a heavy
fine on the concubines of priests if they persisted in their sin for a
year after excommunication. This law, like so many similar ones,
soon fell into desuetude, but in 1317, under his son Robert the
Good, the justiciary of the Principato Citra undertook to put it into
execution. In the diocese of Marsico the clergy openly resisted
these proceedings, boldly laid their complaints before the king, and
were so energetic that Robert was obliged to issue an ordinance
directing the discontinuance of all processes before the lay tribunals,
and granting that the concubines should be left to the care of the
ecclesiastical courts alone. These women thus, by reason of their
sinful courses, came to be invested with a quasi-ecclesiastical character,
and to enjoy the dearly prized immunities attached to that position,
at a time when the church was vigorously striving to uphold
and extend the privileges which the civil lawyers were systematically
laboring to undermine. Nor was the pretension thus advanced suffered
to lapse. Towards the close of the same century, Carlo Malatesta
of Rimini applied to Ancarono, a celebrated doctor of canon
and civil law (“juris canonici speculum et civilis anchora”), to know
whether he could impose penalties on the concubines of priests, and
the learned jurist replied decidedly in the negative; while other
legal authorities have not hesitated to state that such women are
fully entitled to immunity from secular jurisdiction, as belonging to
the families of clerks—<i>de familia clericorum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_853_853" href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">853</a> When a premium
was thus offered for sin, and the mistresses of priests—like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
<i>maîtresses-en-titre</i> of the Bourbons—acquired a certain honorable
position among their fellows from the mere fact of their ministering
to the unhallowed lusts of their pastors, it is not to be wondered at
if such connections multiplied and flourished, and if the humble laity
came to regard them as an established institution.</p>

<p>Robert of Naples was not the only potentate who found an organized
resistance to his well-meant endeavors to restore discipline.
When, in 1410, the stout William, Bishop-elect of Paderborn, had
triumphed with fire and sword over his powerful foes, the Archbishop
of Cologne and the Count of Cleves, he turned his energies to the
reformation of the dissolute morals of his monks. They positively
refused to submit to the ejection of their women from the monasteries,
and he at length found the task too impracticable even for his warlike
temper. For seven long years the quarrel lasted, legal proceedings
being varied by attempts at poison on the one side, and reckless
devastations by the episcopal troops on the other, until the prelate,
worn out by the stubbornness of his flock, was obliged to give way.<a id="FNanchor_854_854" href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">854</a></p>

<p>Equal success waited on the resistance of the Swiss clergy when,
in 1230, the civil authorities of Zurich sacrilegiously ordered them
to dismiss their women. They resolutely replied that they were
flesh and blood, unequal to the task of living like angels, and unable
to attend to the kitchen and other household duties. The townsmen
entered into a league against them, and succeeded in driving away
some of the sacerdotal consorts, when the Bishop of Constance and
his chapter, allowing perhaps the pride of the churchman to get the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
better of ascetic zeal, interfered with a threat of excommunication on
all who should presume to intervene in a matter which related
specially to the church. He absolved the leaguers from the oaths
with which they were mutually bound, and thus restored security to
the priestly households. About the same time Gregory IX. appointed
a certain Boniface to the see of Lausanne. On his installation, the
new bishop commenced with ardor to enforce the canons, but the
clergy conspired against his life, and were so nearly successful that
he incontinently fled, and never ventured to return.<a id="FNanchor_855_855" href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">855</a></p>

<p>If the irregular though permanent connections which everywhere
prevailed had been the only result of the prohibition of marriage,
there might perhaps have been little practical evil flowing from it,
except to the church itself and to its guilty members. When the
desires of man, however, are once tempted to seek through unlawful
means the relief denied to them by artificial rules, it is not easy to
set bounds to the unbridled passions which, irritated by the fruitless
effort at repression, are no longer restrained by a law which has been
broken or a conscience which has lost its power. The records of the
Middle Ages are accordingly full of the evidences that indiscriminate
license of the worst kind prevailed throughout every rank of the
hierarchy.</p>

<p>Even supposing that this fearful immorality were not attributable
to the immutable laws of nature revenging themselves for their
attempted violation, it could readily be explained by the example set
by the central head. Scarcely had the efforts of Nicholas and
Gregory put an end to sacerdotal marriage in Rome when the morals
of the Roman clergy became a disgrace to Christendom. How little
the results of the reform corresponded with the hopes of the zealous
puritans who had brought it about may be gathered from the martyrdom
of a certain Arnolfo, who, under the pontificate of Honorius
II., preached vehemently against the scandals and immorality of the
ecclesiastics of the apostolic city. They succeeded in making away
with him, notwithstanding the protection of Honorius, and the
veneration of the nobles and people who regarded him as a prophet.<a id="FNanchor_856_856" href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">856</a>
When such was the condition of clerical virtue, we can scarcely
wonder that sufficient suffrages were given in 1130 by the sacred
college to Cardinal Pier-Leone to afford him a plausible claim to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
papacy, although he was notoriously stained with the foulest crimes.
Apparently his children by his sister Tropea, and his carrying about
with him a concubine when travelling in the capacity of papal legate,
had not proved a bar to his elevation in the church, nor to his employment
in the most conspicuous and important affairs.<a id="FNanchor_857_857" href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">857</a> A severer
satire on the standard of ecclesiastical morality could scarcely be
imagined than the inculcation by such a man, in his capacity as pope,
of the canons requiring the separation of priests from their wives, on
the plea of the spotless purity required for the service of the altar.<a id="FNanchor_858_858" href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">858</a></p>

<p>What were the influences of the papal court in the next century
may be gathered from the speech which Cardinal Hugo made to the
Lyonese, on the occasion of the departure of Innocent IV. in 1251
from their city, after a residence of eight years—“Friends, since our
arrival here, we have done much for your city. When we came, we
found here three or four brothels. We leave behind us but one.
We must own, however, that it extends without interruption from the
eastern to the western gate”—the crude cynicism of which greatly
disconcerted the Lyonese ladies present.<a id="FNanchor_859_859" href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">859</a> Robert Grosseteste,
Bishop of Lincoln, therefore only reflected the popular conviction
when, on his deathbed in 1253, inveighing against the corruption of
the papal court, he applied to it the lines—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Ejus avaritiæ totus non sufficit orbis,</div>
  <div class="verse">Ejus luxuriæ meretrix non sufficit omnis.<a id="FNanchor_860_860" href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">860</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A hundred years later saw the popes again in France. For forty
years they had bestowed on Avignon all the benefits, moral and
spiritual, arising from the presence of the Vicegerent of Christ, when
Petrarch recorded, for the benefit of friends whom he feared to compromise
by naming, the impressions produced by his long residence
there in the household of a leading dignitary of the church. Language
seems too weak to express his abhorrence of that third Babylon,
that Hell upon Earth, which could furnish no Noah, no Deucalion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
to survive the deluge that alone could cleanse its filth—and yet he
intimates that fear compels him to restrain the full expression of his
feelings. Chastity was a reproach and licentiousness a virtue. The
aged prelates surpassed their younger brethren in wickedness as in
years, apparently considering that age conferred upon them the
license to do that from which even youthful libertines shrank; while
the vilest crimes were the pastimes of pontifical ease.<a id="FNanchor_861_861" href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">861</a> Juvenal and
Brantôme can suggest nothing more shameless or more foul. Nor
was the tone of morality heightened when, fifty years later, Nicholas
de Clemanges takes up the tale. His brief reference to the adulteries
and vileness with which the cardinals befouled the papal court, and
the obscenities in which their families imitated their example, shows
that the matter was so generally understood that it needed no details.<a id="FNanchor_862_862" href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">862</a></p>

<p>The Great Schism perhaps could scarcely be expected to improve
the morals of the papal court. Yet when the church universal, to
close that weary quarrel, agreed to receive one of the competitors as
its head, surely it might have selected, as the visible representative
of God upon earth, some more worthy embodiment of humanity
than Balthazar Cossa, who, as John XXIII., is alone, of the three
competitors, recognized in the list of popes. When the great council
of Constance in 1415 adopted the awful expedient of trying, condemning,
and deposing a pope, the catalogue of crimes—notorious
incest, adultery, defilement, homicide, and atheism—of which the
fathers formally accused him, and which he confessed without defend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>ing
himself,<a id="FNanchor_863_863" href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">863</a> is fearfully suggestive of the corruption which could not
only spawn such a monster, but could elevate him to the highest
place in the hierarchy, and present him for the veneration of
Christendom. It affords a curious insight into the notions of
morality prevalent in the Papal court to observe that when he had
as chamberlain of Boniface IX., scandalized Rome by openly keeping
his brother’s wife as a concubine, the remedy adopted for the
disorder was to create him Cardinal and send him as legate to
Bologna, while the lady was conveyed to her husband in Naples.
The result of this course of procedure was that during his sway at
Bologna two hundred maids, matrons, and widows, including a few
nuns, fell victims to his brutal lust.<a id="FNanchor_864_864" href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">864</a> So obtuse, in fact, were the sensibilities
of the age, that after his release from the prison to which he
had been consigned by the fathers of Constance, his successor, Martin
V. consoled him in his degradation by creating him Dean of the
Sacred College.</p>

<p>If the Councils of Constance and of Bâle worked some apparent
reform in the outward morality of the papacy, their effect soon passed
away. The latter half of the fifteenth century scarcely saw a
supreme pontiff without the visible evidences of human frailty around
him, the unblushing acknowledgment of which is the fittest commentary
on the tone of clerical morality. Sixtus IV. was believed
to embody the utmost possible concentration of human wickedness,<a id="FNanchor_865_865" href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">865</a>
until Borgia came to divide with him the preëminence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
evil. The success of Innocent VIII. in increasing the population
of Rome was a favorite topic with the wits of the day;<a id="FNanchor_866_866" href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">866</a> but the
epitaph which declared that filth, gluttony, avarice, and sloth lay
buried in his tomb<a id="FNanchor_867_867" href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">867</a> did not anticipate the immediate resurrection of
the worst of those vices in the person of his successor Alexander VI.
If the crimes of Borgia were foul, their number and historical importance
have rendered them so well known that I may be spared
more than a passing allusion to a career which has made his name
synonymous with all that can degrade man to a level at once with
the demon and the brute.<a id="FNanchor_868_868" href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">868</a></p>

<p>Such men as Alexander can hardly be deemed exceptional, save
inasmuch as brilliant talents and native force of character might
enable them to excel their contemporaries in guilt as in ambition.
They were the natural product of a system which for four centuries
had bent the unremitting energies of the church to securing temporal
power and wealth, with exemption from the duties and liabilities of
the citizen. Such were the fruits of the successful theocracy of
Hildebrand, which, intrusting irresponsible authority to fallible
humanity, came to regard ecclesiastical aggrandizement as a full
atonement for all and every crime. That the infection had spread
even to the ultimate fibres of the establishment can readily be
believed, for the supremacy of the Papal authority gave it the power
of controlling the character of every parish in Christendom. We
shall see hereafter, as we have already seen, how that power was
habitually abused, and how the nullification of the canons was a
recognized source of income to the successor of St. Peter and his
needy officials. The evil was one that had long been recognized and
complained of since Hincmar of Rheims so emphatically denounced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
it. St. Bernard declared that Rome was the acknowledged refuge
of all ambitious and licentious men who desired either promotion or
to retain the preferment which they had forfeited.<a id="FNanchor_869_869" href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">869</a> In the fiery zeal
with which he warns his protégé, Eugenius III., not to be deceived
by such suitors, he shows us how useless were local efforts at reformation
when they could be so readily set aside and rendered nugatory
by the venal influences at work in the Apostolic court. But the
abuse was too profitable to be suppressed, and it continued until after
the Reformation had shown the necessity of some decent reticence in
the exercise of powers no longer regarded as wholly irresponsible.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My object has been to consider the subject of ascetic celibacy as a
portion simply of ecclesiastical history, and yet I cannot well conclude
this section without a hasty glance at its influence on society
at large. That influence, as far as the secular clergy were its instruments,
was evidently one of almost unmixed evil. The parish priest,
if honestly ascetic, was thereby deprived of the wholesome common
bond of human affections and sympathies, and was rendered less
efficient for good in consoling the sorrows and aiding the struggles
of his flock. If, on the other hand, he was a hypocrite, or if he had
found too late that the burden he had assumed was too heavy for his
strength, the denial of the natural institution of marriage was the
source of immeasurable corruption to those intrusted to his charge,
who looked up to him not only as a spiritual director, but as a
superior being who could absolve them from sin, and whose partnership
in guilt was in itself an absolution.<a id="FNanchor_870_870" href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">870</a> That such was the
condition of innumerable parishes throughout Europe, there is
unfortunately no reason to doubt, and all of the severer churchmen
of the period, in attacking the vices of the clergy, give us to understand
that either their example led the laity into evil, or that their
immorality rendered it impossible for them to correct the vices of the
flocks. As Cæsarius of Heisterbach says, “Since the priesthood
mostly lead evil and incontinent lives, they soothe rather than excite
the consciences of the worldly.”<a id="FNanchor_871_871" href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">871</a> The incongruity of this may per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>haps
explain to some extent the anomaly of the practical grossness of
the Middle Ages, combined with the theoretical ascetic purity which
was held out as the duty of every Christian who desired to be acceptable
to his Creator.</p>

<p>The curious contrasts and confusion of the standard of morality,
arising from this striving against nature, are well illustrated by a
homily of the thirteenth century against marriage, addressed to
youthful nuns, which exhausts all the arguments that the ingenuity
of the writer could suggest. On the one hand he appeals to the
pride which could be so well gratified by the exalted state of virginity;
he pictures the superior bliss vouchsafed in heaven to those who were
stained by no earthly contamination, confidently promising them a
higher rank and more direct communing with the Father than would
be bestowed on the married and the widowed; he rapturously dwells
upon the inward peace, the holy ecstasy which are the portion of
those who, wedded to Christ, keep pure their mystic marriage vow;
and his ascetic fervor exhausts itself in depicting the spiritual delights
of a life of religious seclusion. Mingled inextricably with these exalted
visions of beatific mysticism, he presents in startling contrasts
the retribution awaiting the sin of licentiousness and the evils inseparable
from a life of domestic marriage. With a crude nastiness that
is almost inconceivable, he minutely describes all the discomforts and
suffering, physical and mental, attendant upon wifehood and maternity,
entering into every detail and gloating over every revolting
circumstance that his prurient imagination can suggest. The license
of Shakespeare, the plain speaking of Chaucer, Boccaccio, and the
mediæval trouvères show us what our ancestors were, and what they
were is easily explained when such a medley of mysticism and grossness
could be poured into the pure ears of innocent young girls by
their spiritual director.<a id="FNanchor_872_872" href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">872</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span></p>

<p>Thus, with the fearful immorality of which we have seen such
ample evidence, the church still presented the same exaggerated
asceticism as her guiding principle. The rhapsodies of St. John
Chrysostom and St. Aldhelm were rivalled in an age when the priest
was forbidden to live in the same house as his mother, because experience
had shown the danger of such propinquity. How the estimate
placed on purity increased as virtue diminished is fairly
illustrated in a characteristic legend which was very popular with
ecclesiastical teachers in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. It
relates how a pagan entering a heathen temple saw Satan seated in
state on a throne. One of the princes of Hell entered, worshipped
his master, and proceeded to give an account of his work. For
thirty days he had been engaged in provoking a war, wherein many
battles had been fought with heavy slaughter. Satan sharply reproached
him with accomplishing so little in the time, and ordered
him to be severely punished. Another then approached the throne
and reported that he had devoted twenty days to raising tempests at
sea, whereby navies had been wrecked and multitudes drowned. He
was likewise reproved and punished for wasting his time. A third
had for ten days been engaged in troubling the wedding festivity of a
city, causing strife and murder, and he was similarly treated. A
fourth then entered and recounted how for forty years he had been
occupied in tempting a hermit to yield to fleshly desire, and how he
had that night succeeded. Then Satan arose and placed his crown
on the head of the new-comer, seating him on the throne as one who
had worthily achieved a signal triumph. The spectator, thus seeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
the high estimate placed by the Evil One on ascetic chastity, was
immediately converted, and forthwith became a monk.<a id="FNanchor_873_873" href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">873</a></p>

<p>While thus attaching so fanciful a holiness to virginity, the church
came practically to erect a most singular standard of morality, the
influence of which could but be most deplorable on the mass of the
laity. In the earlier days of celibacy, the rule was regarded by the
severer ecclesiastics as simply an expression of the necessity of purity
in the minister of God. Theophilus of Alexandria, in the fifth
century, decided that a man, who as lector had been punished for
unchastity and had subsequently risen to the priesthood, must be expelled
on account of his previous sin.<a id="FNanchor_874_874" href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">874</a> We have seen, however, how,
when celibacy was revived under Damiani and Hildebrand, the
question of immorality virtually disappeared, and the essential point
became, not that a priest should be chaste, but that he should be unmarried,
and this was finally adopted as the recognized law of the
church. In 1213 the Archbishop of Lunden enquired of Innocent
III. whether a man who had had two concubines was ineligible to
orders as a <i>digamus</i>, and the pontiff could only reply that no matter
how many concubines a man might have, either at one time or in
succession, he did not incur the disability of digamy.<a id="FNanchor_875_875" href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">875</a> When such
was the result of seven centuries of assiduous sacerdotalism in a
church which was daily growing in authority; when the people thus
saw that sexual excesses were no bar to ecclesiastical preferment in
that church which made extravagant pretensions to purity; when the
strict rules which forbade ordination to a layman who had married<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
a widow, were relaxed in favor of those who were stained with
notorious impurity, it is no wonder that the popular perceptions of
morality became blunted, and that the laity did not deny themselves
the indulgences which they saw tacitly allowed to their spiritual
guides.</p>

<p>Nor was it only in stimulating this general laxity of principle
that the influence of the church was disastrous. The personal evil
wrought by a dissolute priesthood was a wide-spreading contagion.
The abuse of the awful authority given by the altar and the confessional,
was a subject of sorrowful and indignant denunciation in too
many synods for a reasonable doubt to be entertained of its frequency
or of the corruption which it spread through innumerable parishes
and nunneries.<a id="FNanchor_876_876" href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">876</a> The almost entire practical immunity with which
these and similar scandals were perpetrated led to an undisguised
and cynical profligacy which the severer churchmen acknowledged to
exercise a most deleterious influence on the morals of the laity, who
thus saw the examplars of evil in those who should have been their
patterns of virtue.<a id="FNanchor_877_877" href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">877</a> In his bull of 1259, Alexander IV. does not
hesitate to declare that the people, instead of being reformed, are
absolutely corrupted by their pastors.<a id="FNanchor_878_878" href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">878</a> Thomas of Cantinpré, one
of the early lights of the Dominican order, indeed, is authority for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
the legend which represents the devil as thanking the prelates of the
church for conducting all Christendom to hell;<a id="FNanchor_879_879" href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">879</a> and the conviction
which thus expressed itself is justified by the reproach of Gregory
X., who, in dismissing the second council of Lyons, in 1274, told
his assembled dignitaries that they were the ruin of the world.<a id="FNanchor_880_880" href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">880</a>
Unfortunately, his threat to reform them if they did not reform
themselves, remained unexecuted, and the complaint was repeated
again and again.<a id="FNanchor_881_881" href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">881</a></p>

<p>That this state of things was clearly understood by the laity is
only too visibly reflected in contemporary records. When, in 1374,
the dancing mania, one of those strange epidemics which afflicted the
Middle Ages, broke out through Germany and Flanders, the populace
called to mind the forgotten regulations of Damiani and Hildebrand,
and found a ready explanation of the visitation by assuming it to be
a consequence of the vitiated baptism of the people by a concubinary
priesthood.<a id="FNanchor_882_882" href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">882</a> Chaucer, with his wide range of observation and
shrewd native sense, took a less superstitious, and more practical view
of the evil, and in the admirable sermon which forms his “Persone’s
Tale” he records the convictions which every pure-minded man
must have felt with regard to the demoralizing tendencies of the
sacerdotal licentiousness of the time.<a id="FNanchor_883_883" href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">883</a></p>

<p>How instinctively, indeed, the popular mind assumed the immorality
of the pastor is illustrated by a passage in the earliest French
pastoral that has reached us, dating from the latter half of the
thirteenth century</p>

<p>Those who were heretically disposed were keen to take advantage
of a weakness so general and so universally understood. The author
of the “Creed of Piers Ploughman” does not hesitate to assert with
Gregory X. that the clergy were the corruption of the world—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p>The widely received feeling on this subject, perhaps, finds its
fittest expression in a satire on the mendicant friars, written by a
Franciscan novice who became disgusted with the order and turned
Wickliffite. The exaggerated purity and mortification of the early
followers of the blessed St. Francis had long since yielded to the
temptations which attended on the magnificent success of the institution,
and the asceticism which had been powerful enough to cause
visions of the holy Stigmata degenerated into sloth and crime which
took advantage of the opportunities afforded by the privilege to hear
confessions. The grosser accusations of the writer are, perhaps,
unfit for quotation, but the spirit in which the Franciscan friars
were regarded is sufficiently indicated by the following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>When such was the moral condition of the priesthood, and such
were the influences which it cast upon the flocks intrusted to its
guidance, it is not to be wondered at if those who deplored so disgraceful
a state of things, and whose respect for the canons precluded
them from recommending the natural and appropriate remedy of
marriage, should regard an organized system of concubinage as a
safeguard. However deplorable such an alternative might be in
itself, it was surely preferable to the mischief which the unquenched
and ungoverned passions of a pastor might inflict upon his parish;
and the instances of this were too numerous and too glaring to admit
of much hesitation in electing between the two evils. Even Gerson,
the leader of mystic ascetics, who recorded his unbounded admiration
for the purity of celibacy in his “Dialogus Naturæ et Sophiæ de
Castitate Clericorum,”<a id="FNanchor_887_887" href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">887</a> saw and appreciated its practical evils, and
had no scruple in recommending concubinage as a preventive,
which, though scandalous in itself, might serve to prevent greater
scandals.<a id="FNanchor_888_888" href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">888</a> It therefore requires no great stretch of credulity to
believe the assertion of Sleidan that in some of the Swiss Cantons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
it was the custom to oblige a new pastor, on entering upon his functions,
to select a concubine, as a necessary protection to the virtue
of his female parishioners, and to the peace of the families intrusted
to his spiritual direction.<a id="FNanchor_889_889" href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">889</a> Indeed, we have already seen, on the
authority of the council of Palencia in 1322, that such a practice was
not uncommon in Spain.</p>

<p>In thus reviewing the influences which a nominally celibate clergy
exercised over those intrusted to their care, it is perhaps scarcely too
much to conclude that they were mainly responsible for the laxity of
morals which is a characteristic of mediæval society. No one who
has attentively examined the records left to us of that society, can
call in question the extreme prevalence of the licentiousness which
everywhere infected it. Christianity had arisen as the great reformer
of a world utterly corrupt. How earnestly its reform was directed
to correcting sexual immorality is visible in the persistence with
which the Apostles condemned and forbade a sin that the Gentiles
scarcely regarded as a sin. The early church was consequently pure,
and its very asceticism is a measure of the energy of its protest
against the all-pervading license which surrounded it. Its teachings,
as we have seen, remained unchanged. Fornication continued to be
a mortal sin, yet the period of its unquestioned domination over the
conscience of Europe was the very period in which license among the
Teutonic races was most unchecked. A church which, though founded
on the Gospel, and wielding the illimitable power of the Roman
hierarchy, could yet allow the feudal principle to extend to the “jus
primæ noctis” or “droit de marquette,” and whose ministers in their
character of temporal seigneurs could even occasionally claim the
disgusting right themselves<a id="FNanchor_890_890" href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">890</a> was evidently exercising its influence not
for good but for evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span></p>

<p>There is no injustice in holding the church responsible for the lax
morality of the laity. It had assumed the right to regulate the consciences
of men and to make them account for every action and even
for every thought. When it promptly caused the burning of those who
ventured on any dissidence in doctrinal opinion or in matters of pure
speculation, it could not plead lack of authority to control them in
practical virtue. Its machinery was all-pervading, and its power
autocratic. It had taught that the priest was to be venerated as the
representative of God and that his commands were to be implicitly
obeyed. It had armed him with the fearful weapon of the confessional,
and by authorizing him to grant absolution and to pronounce
excommunication, it had delegated to him the keys of heaven and
hell. By removing him from the jurisdiction of the secular courts
it had proclaimed him as superior to all temporal authority. Through
ages of faith the populations had humbly received these teachings
and bowed to these assumptions, until they entered into the texture
of the daily life of every man. While thus grasping supremacy and
using it to the utmost possibility of worldly advantage, the church
therefore could not absolve itself from the responsibilities inseparably
connected with power, and chief among these responsibilities is to be
numbered the moral training of the nations thus subjected to its will.
While the corruption of the teachers thus had necessarily entailed
the corruption of the taught, it is not too much to say that the tireless
energy devoted to the acquisition and maintenance of power,
privileges, and wealth, if properly directed, under all the advantages
of the situation, would have sufficed to render mediæval society the
purest that the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>That the contrary was notoriously the case resulted naturally from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
the fact that the church, after the long struggle which finally left it
supreme over Europe, contented itself with the worldly advantages
derivable from the wealth and authority which surpassed its wildest
dreams. If, then, it could secure a verbal submission to its doctrines
of purity, it was willing to issue countless commands of chastity
and to tacitly connive at their perpetual infraction. The taint of
corruption infected equally its own ministers and the peoples committed
to their charge, and the sacerdotal theory gradually came to
regard with more and more indifference obedience to the Gospel in
comparison with obedience to man and subservience to the temporal
interests of the hierarchy. As absolution and indulgence grew to
be a marketable commodity, it even became the interest of the traders
in salvation to have a brisk demand for their wares. When infraction
of the Divine precepts could be redeemed with a few pence or
with the performance of ceremonies that had lost their significance,
it is not surprising if priest and people at length were led to look
upon the violation of the Decalogue with the eye of the merchant
and customer rather than with the spirit of the great Lawgiver.<a id="FNanchor_891_891" href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">891</a></p>

<p>The first impulse in the reaction of the sixteenth century was to
recur to the Gospel and to interpret its commands in accordance with
the immutable principles of human conscience rather than with the
cunningly devised subtleties of scholastic theology. The reformers
thus stood face to face with God, and, needing no intermediary to
negotiate with Him, vice and sin reappeared to them in all their
hideous deformity and attended with all their inevitable consequences.<a id="FNanchor_892_892" href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">892</a>
For the first time since primitive Christianity was absorbed in sacerdotalism,
were the doctrines of morality enforced as the primal laws<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
of man’s being and of human society, and the world was made to
see, by the energetic action of Puritan sects, that virtue was possible
as the rule of life in large communities. We may smile at the eccentricities
of Puritanism, but the rescue of modern civilization from
the long heritage of ancient vice, and the decency which characterizes
modern society, may fairly be attributed to the force of
that fierce reaction against the splendid corruptions of the mediæval
church.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In considering, however, the influence of the regular clergy, or
monastic orders, we find a more complex array of motives and results.
The earlier foundations of the West, as we have seen, to a great
extent neutralized the inherent selfishness of monachism by the
regulations which prescribed a due proportion of labor to be mingled
with prayer. The duty which man owes to the world was to some
extent recognized as not incompatible with the duty which he owed
to his God, and civilization has had few more efficient instruments
than the self-denying work of the earnest men who, from Columba
to Adalbert, sowed the seeds of Christianity and culture among the
frontier lands of Christendom. When discipline such as these men
inculcated could be enforced, the benefits of monachism far outweighed
its evils. All the peaceful arts, from agriculture to music,
owed to the Benedictines their preservation or their advancement,
and it would be difficult to estimate exactly the influence for good
which resulted from institutions to which the thoughtful and studious
could safely retire from a turbulent and barbarous world. These
institutions, however, from their own inherent defects, carried in
them the germs of corruption. The claims to supereminent sanctity,
which secured for them the privileges of asylums, were inevitably
used as means for the accumulation of wealth wrung from the fears
or superstition of the sinner. With wealth came the abandonment
of labor; and idleness and luxury were the prolific parents of license.
True-hearted men were not wanting to combat the irrepressible evil.
From Chrodegang to St. Vincent de Paul, the history of monachism
is full of illustrious names of those who devoted themselves to the
mission of reforming abuses and restoring the ideal of the perfect
monk, dead to the seductions of the world, and living only to do the
work which he deems most acceptable to God. Many of these mistakenly
assumed that exaggerated mortification was the only gateway
to salvation, and the only cure for the frightful immorality which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
pervaded so many monastic establishments. Others, with a truer
insight into the living principles of Christianity, sought to turn the
enthusiasm of their disciples to account in works of perennial mercy
and charity, at a period when no other organizations existed for the
succor of the helpless and miserable.</p>

<p>Yet when we reflect how large a proportion of the wealth and
intellect of Europe was absorbed in the religious houses, it will be
seen that the system was a most cumbrous and imperfect one, which
gave but a slender return for the magnitude of the means which it
involved. Still, it was the only system existing, and possibly the
only one which could exist in so rude a structure of society, individualized
to a degree which destroyed all sense of public responsibility,
and precluded all idea of a state created for the well-being of
its component parts. Thus, the monastery became the shelter of
the wayfarer, and the dispenser of alms to the needy. It was the
principal school of the poor and humble; and while the Universities
of Oxford and Paris were devoting their energies to unprofitable
dialectics and the subtle disputations of Aristotelian logic, in multitudes
of abbey libraries quiet monks were multiplying priceless
manuscripts, and preserving to after ages the treasures of the past.
When fanciful asceticism did not forbid the healing of the sick,
monks labored fearlessly in hospitals and pest-houses, and distributed
among the many the benefactions which they had wrung from the
late repentance of the few. As time wore on, even the religious
teaching of the public passed almost exclusively into their hands,
and to the followers of Dominic and Francis of Assisi the people
owed such insight as they could obtain into the promises of the
gospel. If the enthusiasm which prompted labors so strenuous did
not shrink from lighting the fires of persecution, we must remember
that religious zeal, accompanied by irresponsible power, has one
invariable history.</p>

<p>While thus, in various ways, the ascetic spirit led to institutions
which promoted the progress of civilization, in others it necessarily
had a directly opposite tendency. Nothing contributes more strongly
to the extension of knowledge and of culture than the striving for
material comfort and individual advancement in worldly well-being.
Luxury and ambition thus have their uses in stimulating the inquiring
and inventive faculties of man, in rendering the forces of nature
subservient to our use, and in softening the rugged asperities which
are incompatible with the regular administration of law. Every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
instinct of human nature has its destined purpose in life, and the
perfect man is to be found in the proportionate cultivation of each
element of his character, not in the exaggerated development of
those faculties which are deemed primarily good, nor in the entire
repression of those which are evil only when their prominence destroys
the balance of the whole. The ascetic selected for eradication
one group of human aspirations, which was the most useful under
proper discipline, and not perhaps the worst even in its ordinary
excess. Only those who have studied the varied aspects of mediæval
society can rightly estimate the enormous influence which the
church possessed, in those ages of faith, to mould the average habits
of thought in any desired direction. It can readily be seen that if
the tireless preaching of the vanity of human things and the beatitude
of mortification occasionally produced such extravagances as
those of the flagellants, the spirit which now and then burst forth
in such eruption must have been an element of no little power in
the forces which governed society at large, and must have exercised
a most depressing influence in restraining the general advance of
civilization. Not only did it thus more or less weigh down the
efforts of almost every man, but the ardent minds that would otherwise
have been leaders in the race of progress were the ones most
likely, under the pervading spirit of the age, to be the foremost in
maceration and self-denial; while those who would not yield to the
seduction were either silenced or wasted their wisdom on a generation
which believed too much to believe in them. When idleness
was holy, earnest workers had little chance.</p>

<p>The effect of monastic asceticism in moulding the character may
be seen in the admiring picture drawn by a disciple in the fifteenth
century of a shining light of the Carthusian order in the monastery
of Vallis Dei, near Seez in Normandy. He had every virtue, he was
an earnest reader and transcriber of MSS., and he practised mortifications
even greater than those prescribed by the severe rules of the
order. He rarely slept on the couch provided for each brother, but
passed his nights in prayer on the steps of the altar. In the hair
shirt worn next his skin he cultivated lice and maggots so assiduously
that they were often seen crawling over his face, and he scourged
himself for every unhallowed wandering thought. He had preserved
his virginity to old age, and his life had been passed in the church,
yet in his daily confessions he accused himself of every sin possible
to man, and he rigorously performed whatever penance was assigned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
to him. With all this maceration, the flesh would still assert itself,
and he was tormented with evil desires which the sharp cords of the
discipline failed to subdue. His office of procureur of the abbey
required him to make frequent visits on business to the neighboring
town, and he never left the gates of his retreat without lamenting
and expressing the fear that he should not return to it the same as
he left it.<a id="FNanchor_893_893" href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">893</a> If we consider what might have been effected by the
energies of thousands of men such as this, had those energies not
been absorbed in lifelong asceticism, we may conceive in some measure
the retardation of human progress wrought by the influence of
monachism.</p>

<p>Another result which may fairly be attributed to the ascetic teachings
of the church is the slow growth of population during the mediæval
period. Notwithstanding the gross and flagrant disregard of
the rule, it was impossible to immure in convents men and women
by the hundred thousand during successive generations without
retarding greatly the rate of increase of the species. The rudeness
of the arts and sciences, war, pestilence and famine were doubtless
efficient causes, yet were they less efficient than enforced celibacy.
This is evident when we see the rapid rate of growth established on
the abrogation or even relaxation of the rule. The suppression of
the monastic orders in France followed soon after the reforms by
which Joseph II. discouraged them throughout the Austrian empire,
and the result is visible in the enormous increase of European population
which followed, notwithstanding the fearful destruction of life
in the Napoleonic wars. It is calculated that in 1788 Europe numbered
144,561,000 souls, which within fifty years had been augmented
to 253,622,000, or about seventy-five per cent. Of late
years the birth-rate has decreased in consequence of the severity of
conscription in the military monarchies, but the enormous growth in
the half-century following the French Revolution is the best commentary
on the influences which for so many ages kept the population
almost stationary.<a id="FNanchor_894_894" href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">894</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It required the unbelief of the fifteenth century to give free rein
to the rising commercial energies and the craving for material im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>provement
that paved the way for the overthrow of ascetic sacerdotalism.
The fearful corruptions of the church, which indirectly
caused and accompanied that awakening of the human mind, will be
alluded to hereafter when we come to consider the movements leading
to the great Protestant Reformation. At present we must turn
aside for a moment to consider one or two external developments
of the religious activity of the Middle Ages.</p>

<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII">XXII.</a><br />

THE MILITARY ORDERS.</h2>


<p>The Military Orders were the natural expression of the singular
admixture of religious and warlike enthusiasm, reacting on each
other, which produced and was fostered by the Crusades. When
bishops considered that they rendered a service acceptable to God in
leading vast hosts to slaughter the Paynim, it was an easy transition
for soldiers to turn monks, and to consecrate their swords to the
bloody work of avenging their Redeemer.</p>

<p>When the Hospitallers—Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, of
Rhodes, or of Malta—first emerged from their humble position of
ministering to the afflictions of their fellow-pilgrims, and commenced
to assume a military organization under Raymond du Puy, about
the year 1120, their statutes required the three ordinary monastic
vows of poverty, obedience, and chastity.<a id="FNanchor_895_895" href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">895</a> In fact, they were at
first Benedictines; but when they became numerous enough to form
a separate body, they adopted the rule of St. Augustin.</p>

<p>When the rule for the Templars—“Regula pauperum commilitonum
sanctæ civitatis”—was adopted in 1128, at the council of
Troyes, it contained no special injunction to administer a vow of
celibacy, but the context shows that such a condition was understood
as a matter of course.<a id="FNanchor_896_896" href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">896</a> Some little difficulty was evidently experi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>enced
at first, since, from the nature of the case, novices had to be
trained warriors who must frequently have been bound by family
ties, and whose education had not been such as to fit them for the
restraints of their new life. It is probable also that the perpetual
nature of the obligations assumed was not easy to be enforced upon
the fierce members of the brotherhood, for, in 1183, Lucius III., in
confirming the privileges of the order, specially commands that no
one who enters it shall be allowed to return to the world.<a id="FNanchor_897_897" href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">897</a></p>

<p>The history of these two orders is too well known to require it to
be traced minutely here. If, with the growth of their reputation
and wealth, the austere asceticism of their early days was lost, and
if luxury and vice took the place of religious enthusiasm and soldierly
devotion to the Cross, they but obeyed the universal law which
in human institutions is so apt to render corruption the consequence
of prosperity. One conclusion may be drawn, however, from the
proceedings by which the powerful order of the Temple was extinguished
at the commencement of the fourteenth century. Notwithstanding
the open and scandalous licentiousness of the order, it is a
little singular that the interminable articles of accusation against the
members contain no allusion to unchastity, while crimes most fantastic,
practices most beastly, and charges most frivolous are heaped
upon them in strange confusion.<a id="FNanchor_898_898" href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">898</a> As the object of those who conducted
the prosecution was to excite a popular abhorrence that would
justify the purposed spoliation, it is evident that the simple infraction
of vows of chastity was regarded as so venial a fault and so much a
matter of course that its proof could in no way serve the end of
rousing indignation against the accused.</p>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that the same century which saw the
foundation of the orders of the Hospital and Temple also witnessed
one which, although bound by the rule of St. Augustin, and subjected
to the ordinary vows of obedience, property in common, and
inability to return to the world, yet allowed to its members the option
of selecting either marriage or celibacy, and even of contracting second
marriages. This was the Spanish Order of St. James of the
Sword. What we have seen of the want of respect paid by the
Spanish church to asceticism may lessen surprise at the founding of
an order based upon such regulations, yet it is difficult to understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
how so great a violation of established principles could be sanctioned
by Alexander III., who confirmed the order in 1175,<a id="FNanchor_899_899" href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">899</a> or by Innocent
III. and Honorius III., who formally approved its privileges.<a id="FNanchor_900_900" href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">900</a>
Perhaps these military vassals of the pope, to whom they were bound
in implicit obedience as their head, were too important a source of
power and influence to be lightly rejected. Perhaps, also, Honorius
III. may have quieted his conscience when, in confirming their
charters in 1223, he commanded that their principal care and watchfulness
should be devoted to seeing that those who were married
preserved conjugal fidelity, and that those who elected a single life
maintained inviolable chastity.</p>

<p>The example was one of evil import in the Peninsula. The
Council of Valladolid in 1322 felt itself obliged to denounce under
severe penalties the practice of dowering children with the possessions
of the community, in which the military orders followed the precedent
set them by the church.<a id="FNanchor_901_901" href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">901</a> During the universal license of the
fifteenth century, when ascetic vows became a mockery, and the
profligacy of those who took them exposed all such observances to
contempt, the military orders formed no exception to the general
shamelessness. In 1429 the council of Tortosa deplored the destruction
and waste of the temporal possessions of the religious knights
from the general concubinage in which they indulged, and to effect a
cure it promulgated regulations of peculiar severity, threatening with
a liberal hand the penalties of excommunication and degradation.<a id="FNanchor_902_902" href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">902</a>
These proved as powerless as usual, and not long after a more
sensible remedy was adopted by Eugenius IV. when he released the
ancient and renowned Order of Calatrava from the obligation of
celibacy, for reasons which would have led him to extend the privilege
of marriage to the whole church, had the purity of ecclesiastics been
truly the object of the rule. He recounts with sorrow the disorderly
lives of the knights, and, quoting the text which says that it is better
to marry than to burn, he grants the privilege of marriage because
he deems it preferable to live with a wife than with a mistress.<a id="FNanchor_903_903" href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">903</a>
How could he avoid applying his own reasoning to the church in
general?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span></p>

<p>Similar arguments were employed to extend the same privilege to
the Orders of Avis and of Jesus Christ, of Portugal. The former
was founded in 1147 by Alfonso I., under the Cistercian rule,
and chastity was one of its fundamental obligations;<a id="FNanchor_904_904" href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">904</a> the latter was
the continuation of the order of the Temple, which, preserved in
Portugal by the humanity of King Dionysius, assumed in the fourteenth
century the name of Jesus. Both institutions became incurably
corrupted; their preceptories were dens of avowed and
scandalous prostitution, and their promiscuous amours filled the
kingdom with hate and dissension. When at length, in 1496, King
Emanuel applied to Alexander VI. to grant the privilege of marriage,
in hopes of reforming the orders, it is interesting to observe how
instinctively the minds of men turned to this as the sole efficient
remedy for the immorality which all united in attributing to the
hopeless attempt to enforce a purity impossible in the existing condition
of society. Alexander assented to the request, and bestowed on
the orders the right of marriage on the same conditions as those
enjoined on the Knights of St. James of the Sword.<a id="FNanchor_905_905" href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">905</a> It is true
that Osorius doubts whether the benefits of the change were not
exceeded by its evils, as he states that it lowered the character of the
orders, opened the door to unworthy members, and led to the dissipation
of their property.<a id="FNanchor_906_906" href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">906</a></p>

<p>There was another Portuguese order of a somewhat different
character. Twenty years after founding the Knights of Avis,
Alfonso I., in 1167, to commemorate his miraculous victory over the
Moors at Santarem, instituted the Order of St. Michael. The
knights were allowed to marry once; if widowed, they were obliged
to embrace celibacy; and the Abbot of Alcobaça, who was the
superior of the Order, was empowered to excommunicate them for
irregularity of life, to compel them to give up their mistresses.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
They were moreover bound to perform the same religious exercises
as lay brothers of the Cistercians. The Order is interesting as
forming a curious link between the secular, religious, and military
elements of the period.<a id="FNanchor_907_907" href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">907</a></p>

<p>During all this, the knights of St. John adhered to their ancient
statutes, and endeavored from time to time to reform the profligacy
which seemed inseparable from the institution. When the ascetic
Antonio Fluviano, who held the grand mastership from 1421 to
1437, promulgated a regulation that any one guilty of public concubinage
should receive three warnings, with severe penalties for
contumacy,<a id="FNanchor_908_908" href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">908</a> it suggests a condition of morals by no means creditable
to the brethren. So, a century later, the stern Villiers de l’Isle-Adam
was forced to declare that any one openly acknowledging an
illegitimate child should be forever after incapacitated for office,
benefice, or dignity.<a id="FNanchor_909_909" href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">909</a> What the knights were soon afterwards, the
scandalous pages of Brantôme sufficiently attest.</p>

<p>The Marian or Teutonic Order, perhaps the most wealthy and
powerful of all, was founded in 1190, and adopted the rule of the
Templars as regards its religious government, with that of the
Hospitallers to regulate its duties of charity and hospitality. For a
full century of its existence it was sorely oppressed with poverty,<a id="FNanchor_910_910" href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">910</a>
but at length, when transferred from the Holy Land to Northeastern
Germany, it bore a prominent part in Christianizing those regions,
and what it won by the sword it retained possession of in its own
right. With wealth came indolence and luxury, and the order
became corrupt, as others had been.<a id="FNanchor_911_911" href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">911</a> Its history offers nothing of
special interest to us until, in 1525, the grand master Albert of
Brandenburg went over to Lutheranism with many of his knights,
founded the hereditary dukedom of Prussia, and married—of which
more hereafter. Those of the order who adhered to Catholicism
maintained the organization on the rich possessions which the piety
of ages had bestowed upon them throughout Germany, until this
worn-out relic of the past disappeared in the convulsions of the
Napoleonic wars.</p>

<h2><a name="XXIII" id="XXIII">XXIII.</a><br />

THE HERESIES.</h2>


<p>Allusion has already been made to the introduction of Manichæism
into Western Europe through Bulgaria and Lombardy.
Notwithstanding its stern and unrelenting suppression wherever it
was discovered during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, its votaries
multiplied in secret. The disorders of the clergy, their oppression
of the people, and their quarrels with the nobles over their temporal
possessions made them many enemies among the laity; and the
simplicity of the Manichæan belief, its freedom from aspirations for
temporal aggrandizement, and its denunciations of the immorality
and grasping avidity of the priesthood, found for it an appreciative
audience and made ready converts. Towards the close of the twelfth
century the South of France was discovered to be filled with heretics,
in whom the names of Cathari, Paterins, Albigenses, &amp;c., concealed
the more odious appellation of Manichæans.</p>

<p>It is not our province to trace out in detail the bloody vicissitudes
of Dominic’s Inquisition and Simon de Montfort’s crusades. It is
sufficient for our purpose to indicate the identity of the Albigensian
belief with that of the ancient sect which we have seen to exercise
so powerful an influence in moulding and encouraging the asceticism
of the early church. The Dualistic principle was fully recognized.
No necessity was regarded as justifying the use of meat, or even of
eggs and cheese, or in fact of anything which had its origin in animal
propagation. Marriage was an abomination and a mortal sin, which
could not be intensified by adultery or other excesses.<a id="FNanchor_912_912" href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">912</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span></p>

<p>Engrafted on these errors were others more practically dangerous,
as they were the inevitable protest against the all-absorbing sacerdotalism
which by this time had become the distinguishing characteristic
of the church. In denying the existence of purgatory, and the
efficacy of prayers for the dead and the invocation of saints, a mortal
blow was aimed against the system to which the church owed its
firmest hold on the souls and purses of the people. In reviving the
Hildebrandine doctrine that the sacraments were not to be administered
by ecclesiastics in a state of sin, and in exaggerating it into an
incompatibility between sin and holding church preferment, a most
dangerous and revolutionary turn was given to the wide-spread discontent
with which the excesses of the clergy were regarded.<a id="FNanchor_913_913" href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">913</a> So
sure a hold, indeed, had such views upon the popular feeling, that
we find them reappear with every heresy, transmitted with regular
filiation through the Waldenses, the Wickliffites, and the Hussites, so
that in every age, from Gregory to the Reformation, the measures
with which he broke down the independence of the local clergy
returned to plague their inventors.</p>

<p>Yet with all this, the heretics to outward appearance long continued
unexceptionably orthodox. Industrious and sober, none were
more devoted to all the observances of the church, none more
regular at mass and confessional, more devout at the altar or more
liberal at the offertory. Hidden beneath this fair seeming, their
heresy was only the more dangerous, as it attracted converts with
unexampled rapidity. Priests gave up their churches to join the
society, wives left their husbands, and husbands abandoned their
wives; and when questioned as to their renunciation of the duties
and privileges of marriage, they all professed to be bound with a vow
of chastity. Yet if so ardent a combatant as St. Bernard is to be
believed, their rigorous asceticism was only a cloak for libertinism.
It is possible that the enthusiastic self-mortification of the sectaries
led them to test their resolution by the dangerous experiments common
among the early Christians, and possibly also with the same
deplorable results. St. Bernard at least argues that constant companionship
of the sexes without sin would require a greater miracle
than raising the dead, and as these heretics could not perform the
lesser prodigy, it was reasonable to presume that they failed of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
greater—and his conclusion is not unlikely to be true.<a id="FNanchor_914_914" href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">914</a> Be this as it
may, the virtue of these puritan sects rendered chastity dangerous to the
orthodox, for the celebrated Peter Cantor relates as a fact within his own
knowledge, that honest matrons who resisted the attempts of priests to
seduce them were accused of Manichæism and condemned as heretics.<a id="FNanchor_915_915" href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">915</a></p>

<p>The orthodox polemics, in controverting the exaggerated asceticism
of these heretics, had a narrow and a difficult path to tread. Their
own authorities had so exalted the praises of virgin purity, that it
was not easy to meet the arguments of those who merely carried out
the same principle somewhat further, in fearlessly following out the
premises to their logical conclusion.<a id="FNanchor_916_916" href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">916</a> There is extant a curious tract,
being a dialogue between a Catholic and a Paterin, in which the
latter of course has the worst of the disputation, yet he presses his
adversary hard with the texts which were customarily cited by the
orthodox advocates of clerical celibacy—“qui habent uxores sint
tanquam non habentes,” “qui non reliquerit uxorem et filios propter
me non est me dignus,” &amp;c.; and the Catholic can only elude their
force by giving to them metaphorical explanations very different from
those which of old had been assumed in the canons requiring the
separation of man and wife on ordination.<a id="FNanchor_917_917" href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">917</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span></p>

<p>The stubborn resistance of the Albigenses to the enormous odds
brought against them shows the unconquerable vitality of the antisacerdotal
spirit which was then so widely diffused throughout
Southern Europe. In a different shape it had already manifested
itself during the first half of the twelfth century, when Pierre de
Bruys infected all the South of France with the heresy called, after
him and his most noted follower, the Petrobrusian or Henrician.
This was an uncompromising revolt against the whole system of
Roman Christianity. It not only abrogated pædo-baptism, and promulgated
heretical notions respecting the Eucharist, but it abolished
the visible symbols and ceremonies which formed so large a portion
of the sacerdotal fabric—churches, crucifixes, chanting, fasting, gifts
and offerings for the dead, and even the mass. But little is known
respecting the Petrobrusians, except what can be derived from the
refutation of their errors by Peter the Venerable. He says nothing
specifically respecting their views upon ascetic celibacy, but we may
assume that this was one of the doctrinal and practical corruptions
which they assailed, from a passage in which, describing their excesses,
he complains of the public eating of flesh on Passion Sunday, the
cruel flagellation of priests, the imprisonment of monks, and their
being forced to marry by threats and torments. Even after de Bruys
was burned alive in 1146, his disciple, Henry, boldly carried on the
contest, and the papal legate, Cardinal Alberic, sent for St. Bernard
to assist him in suppressing the heretics. The latter, in a letter
written in 1147 to the Count of Toulouse, describes the religious
condition of his territories as most deplorable in consequence of the
prevalence of the heresy—the churches were without congregations,
the pastors without flocks, the people without pastors, the sacraments
without reverence, the dying without consolation, and the new-born
without baptism. Even making allowance for some exaggeration in
all this, there can be no doubt that the heresy received extensive
popular support and that it was professed publicly without disguise.
At Alby it was dominant, so that when the Cardinal-legate went
there, the people received him in derision with asses and drums, and
when he preached, scarce thirty persons assembled to hear him; but
two days later St. Bernard so affected them with his eloquence that
they renounced their errors. He was less successful at Vertfeuil
where resided a hundred knights-banneret, who refused to listen to
him, and whom he cursed in consequence, whereof they all perished
miserably. Though St. Bernard was forced to return to Clairvaux<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
without accomplishing the extirpation of the heresy, Henry was
finally captured, and probably died in prison.<a id="FNanchor_918_918" href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">918</a></p>

<p>In Britanny, about the same period, there existed an obscure sect
concerning whom little is known, except that they were probably a
branch of the Petrobrusians. Their errors were nearly the same,
and the slender traces left of them show that their doctrine was a
protest against the overwhelming sacerdotalism of the period. The
papal legate, Hugh, Archbishop of Rouen, sought to convert them
by an elaborate denunciation of their tenets, among which he
enumerates promiscuous licentiousness and disregard of clerical
celibacy. Daniel, he gravely assures them, symbolizes virginity;
Noah, continence; and Job, marriage. Then, quoting Ezekiel <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span>
13-20, wherein Jehovah, threatening the land with destruction, says,
“Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they
should deliver but their own souls through their righteousness,” he
proceeds triumphantly to the conclusion that recantation alone can
save his adversaries from the fate which their errors have deserved.<a id="FNanchor_919_919" href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">919</a></p>

<p>It was probably another branch of the same sect which was discovered
at Liége in 1144, described as brought thither from the south
and pervading all France and the neighboring countries. Its followers
denied the efficacy of baptism, of the Eucharist and of the
imposition of hands; they rejected not only oaths and vows, but
marriage itself, and denied that the Holy Spirit could be gained
except through good works. These heretics, however, had not in
them the spirit of martyrdom, and speedily recanted on being discovered.<a id="FNanchor_920_920" href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">920</a></p>

<p>Connected probably in some way with these movements of insubordination,
was the career of the singular heresiarch, Éon de l’Étoile.
During one of the epidemics of maceration and fanaticism which form
such curious episodes in mediæval history, Éon, born of a noble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
Breton family, abandoned himself to the savage life of a hermit in
the wilderness. Drawn by a vision to attend divine service, his
excited mysticism caught the words which ended the recitation of
the collect, “Per <i>eum</i> qui venturus est judicare vivos et mortuos;”
and the resemblance of “eum” with his own name inspired him with
the revelation that he was the Son of God. Men’s minds were
ready for any extravagance, and Éon soon had disciples who adored
him as a deity incarnate. Nothing can be wilder than the tales
which are related of him by eye-witnesses—the aureole of glory
which surrounded him, the countless wealth which was at the disposal
of his followers, the rich but unsubstantial banquets which were
served at his bidding by invisible hands, the superhuman velocity of
his movements when eluding those who were bent on his capture.
Éon declared war upon the churches which monopolized the wealth
of the people while neglecting the duties for which they had been
enriched; and he pillaged them of their treasures, which he distributed
lavishly to the poor. At last the Devil abandoned his protégé.
Éon, when his time had come, was easily taken and carried before
Eugenius III. at the Council of Rouen, in 1148. There he boldly
proclaimed his mission and his power. Exhibiting a forked staff
which he carried, he declared that when he held it with the fork
upwards, God ruled heaven and hell, and he governed the earth; but
that when he reversed its position, then he had at command two-thirds
of the universe, and left only the remaining third to God.
He was pronounced hopelessly insane, but this would not have saved
him had not his captor, the Archbishop of Rheims, represented that
his life had been pledged to him on his surrender. He was therefore,
delivered to Suger, Abbot of St. Denis, to be imprisoned, and
he soon afterwards died. Even this did not shake the faith of his
disciples. Many of them, in their fierce fanaticism, preferred the
stake to recantation, and numbers of them were thus put to death
before the heresy could be extinguished.<a id="FNanchor_921_921" href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">921</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When, about the middle of the twelfth century, the sudden death
of a companion so impressed Peter Waldo of Lyons that he dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>tributed
his fortune among the poor, and devoted himself to preaching
the supereminent merits of poverty, nothing was farther from his
thoughts than the founding of a new heresy. Ardent disciples
gathered around him, disseminating his views, which spread with
rapidity; but their intention was to establish a society within the
church, and they applied, between 1181 and 1185, to Lucius III.
for the papal authorization. Lucius, however, took exception to
their going barefoot, to their neglect of the tonsure, and to their
retaining the society of women. They were stubborn, and he condemned
them as heretics.<a id="FNanchor_922_922" href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">922</a> The enthusiasm which the church might
have turned to so much account, as it subsequently did that of the
Franciscans and Dominicans, was thus diverted to unorthodox channels,
and speedily arrayed itself in opposition. The character of the
revolt is shown in a passage of the <i>Nobla Leyczon</i>, written probably
not long after this time, which declares that all the popes, cardinals,
bishops, and abbots together cannot obtain pardon for a single mortal
sin; thus leading directly to the conclusion that no intercessor could
be of avail between God and man—</p>

<p>
Ma yo aus o dire, car se troba en ver,<br />
Que tuit li papa que foron de Silvestre entro en aquest,<br />
Et tuit li cardinal et tuit li vesque e tuit li aba,<br />
Tuit aquisti ensemp non han tan de potesta,<br />
Que ilh poissan perdonar un sol pecca mortal.<br />
Solament Dio perdona, que autre non ho po far.<a id="FNanchor_923_923" href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">923</a><br />
</p>

<p>Still, they did not even yet consider themselves as separated from
the church, for they consented to submit their peculiar doctrines to
the chances of a disputation, presided over by an orthodox priest.
Of course, the decision went against them, and a portion of the
“Poor Men of Lyons” submitted to the result. The remainder,
however, maintained their faith as rigidly as ever. From Bernard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
de Font-Cauld, who records this disputation, and from Alain de
l’Isle, another contemporary, who wrote in confutation of their
errors, we have a minute account of their peculiarities of belief.
Their principal heresy was a strict adherence to the Hildebrandine
doctrine that neither reverence nor obedience was due to priests in
mortal sin, whose ministrations to the living and whose prayers for
the dead were equally to be despised. In the existing condition of
sacerdotal morals, this necessarily destroyed all reverence for the
church at large, and Bernard and Alain had no hesitation in proving
it to be most dangerously heterodox. Their recurrence to Scripture,
moreover, as the sole foundation of Christian belief, with the claim
of private interpretation, was necessarily destructive to all the forms
of sacerdotalism, and led them to entertain many other heretical
tenets. They admitted no distinction between clergy and laity.
Every member of the sect, male or female, was a priest, entitled to
preach and to hear confessions. Purgatory was denied, and the
power of absolution derided. Lying and swearing were mortal
sins, and homicide was not excusable under any circumstances.<a id="FNanchor_924_924" href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">924</a>
Yet naturally they did not repudiate the ascetic principles of the
church, and they regarded continence as counselled, though not
commanded, by the Christian dispensation—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">La ley velha maudi lo ventre que fruc non a porta,</div>
  <div class="verse">Ma la novella conselha gardar vergeneta.<a id="FNanchor_925_925" href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">925</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Though marriage is praised and its purity is to be preserved—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Gardes ferm lo matrimoni, aquel noble convent,<a id="FNanchor_926_926" href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">926</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>thus showing their disapproval of the Manichæan doctrines of the
Cathari and Paterins.</p>

<p>Independence such as this could only result in open revolt against
sacerdotalism in general, and it shortly came. The Waldensian
exaltation of poverty was grateful to the nobles, who were eager to
grasp the possessions of the church; its condemnation of the pride
and immorality of the clergy secured for its sectaries the goodwill of
the people, who everywhere suffered from the oppression and vices
of their pastors. Under such protection the sect multiplied with
incredible rapidity, not only throughout France, but in Italy and
Germany. Enveloped, with the Albigenses, in merciless perse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>cution,
they endured with fortitude the extremity of martyrdom.
The Germans and Italians sought refuge in the recesses of the Alpine
valleys, and in the Marches of Brandenburg and Bohemia, where
they seem to have adopted the custom of sacerdotal marriage, and
where in time they merged with the churches of the Orthodox Brethren.<a id="FNanchor_927_927" href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">927</a>
Some feeble remnants also managed to maintain an obscure
existence in Provence, but their tacit revolt could not be forgotten
or forgiven, and at intervals they were exposed to pitiless attempts
at extermination. These are well known, and the names of Cabrières
and Merindol have acquired a sinister notoriety which renders
further allusion to the Waldenses unnecessary, except to mention
that in 1538 they formally merged themselves with the German
reformers by an agreement of which the 8th and 9th articles declare
that marriage is permissible, without exception of position, to all
who have not received the gift of continence.<a id="FNanchor_928_928" href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">928</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The antisacerdotal spirit, however, did not develop itself altogether
in opposition to the church. Devout and earnest men there were,
who recognized the evil resulting from the overgrown power and
wealth of the ecclesiastical establishment, without shaking off their
reverence for its doctrine and its visible head, and the authorities at
length saw in these men the effective means of combating the enemy.
In thus availing themselves of one branch of the reformers to destroy
the other and more radical portion, the chiefs of the hierarchy were
adopting an expedient effective for the present, yet fraught with
danger for the future. The Franciscans and Dominicans were useful
beyond expectation. They restored to the church much of the popular
veneration which had become almost hopelessly alienated from
it, and their wonderfully rapid extension throughout Europe shows
how universally the people had felt the want of a religion which
should fitly represent the humility, the poverty, the charity of Christ.
Yet when Innocent III. hesitated long to sanction the mendicant
orders, he by no means showed the want of sagacity which has been
so generally asserted by superficial historians; rather, like Lucius
III. with the Waldenses, his far-seeing eye took in the possible
dangers of that fierce ascetic enthusiasm which might at any moment
break the bonds of earthly obedience, when its exalted convictions
should declare that obedience to man was revolt against God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span></p>

<p>Before the century was out, the result was apparent. When St.
Francis erected poverty into an object of adoration, attaching to it
an importance as insane as that attributed to virginity by the early
ascetics, he at once placed himself in opposition to the whole system
of the church establishment, though his exquisite humility and exhaustless
charity might disguise the dangerous tendency of his doctrines.<a id="FNanchor_929_929" href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">929</a>
As his order grew in numbers and wealth with unexampled
rapidity, it necessarily declined from the superhuman height of self-abnegation
of which its founder was the model. Already, in 1261,
the council of Mainz can hardly find words severe enough to condemn
the mendicant friars who wandered around selling indulgences
and squandering their unhallowed gains in the vilest excesses. One
of these lights of the order publicly preached, in the horse-market
of Strassburg, the doctrine that a nun who surrendered her virtue
to a monk was less guilty than if she had an intrigue with a layman.<a id="FNanchor_930_930" href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">930</a>
This falling from grace naturally produced dissatisfaction among those
impracticable spirits who still regarded St. Francis as their exemplar
as well as their patron. The breach gradually widened, until at
length two parties were formed in the order. The ascetics finally
separated themselves from their corrupted brethren, and under the
name of Begghards in Germany, Frèrots in France, and Fraticelli
in Southern Europe, assumed the position of being the only true
church. Their excommunication at the council of Vienne, in 1311,
in no wise disconcerted them. The long-forgotten doctrines of
Arnold of Brescia were revived and intensified. Poverty was an
absolute necessity to true Christianity; the holding of property was
a heresy, and the Roman church was consequently heretic. Rome,
indeed, was openly denounced as the modern Babylon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span></p>

<p>While thus carrying out to its necessary consequences the sanctification
of poverty, which was the essence of Franciscanism, they
were equally logical with regard to the doctrines of ascetic purity
which had been so earnestly enforced by the church. Their admiration
of virginity thus trenched closely on Manichæism, and in combating
their errors the church was scarcely able to avoid condemning
both the vow of poverty and that of celibacy, which were the corner-stones
of the monastic theory.<a id="FNanchor_931_931" href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">931</a> Active persecution, of course,
aroused equally active resistance. The Fraticelli espoused the cause
of the Emperor Louis of Bavaria, in his long and disastrous quarrel
with John XXII., whom they did not hesitate to excommunicate.
Exterminated after a prolonged and desperate struggle, their memory
was blackened with the slanders disseminated by a priesthood
incapable of emulating their ascetic virtues; and principal among
these slanders was the accusation which we find repeated on all occasions
when an adversary is to be rendered odious—that of promiscuous
and brutal licentiousness. No authentic facts, however, can be
found to substantiate it.<a id="FNanchor_932_932" href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">932</a></p>

<p>The Fraticelli form a connecting link in the generations of heresy.
Their errors, as taught by one of their most noted leaders, Walter
Lolhard, who was burned at Cologne in 1322, had a tinge of the
Manichæism of the Albigenses, for Satan was to them an object of
compassion and veneration.<a id="FNanchor_933_933" href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">933</a> Their prevalence in Bohemia prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
the ground for Huss, and left deep traces in the popular mind which
were not eradicated in the eighteenth century; while their proselytes
in England served to swell the party of Wickliffe, and eventually
gave to it their name, though their peculiar doctrines bore little
resemblance to his.<a id="FNanchor_934_934" href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">934</a> Antisacerdotalism, however, was the common
tie, and in this Luther, Zwingli, and Knox were the legitimate successors
of Dolcino and Michael di Cesena.</p>

<p>Another precursor of Wickliffe and Huss was John of Pirna, who
in 1341 taught the most revolutionary doctrines. According to him,
the pope was Antichrist and Rome was the whore of Babylon and
the church of Satan. The Silesians listened eagerly to his denunciations
of the clergy, and the citizens of Breslau, with their magistrates,
openly embraced his heresy. When the Inquisitor, John of
Schweidnitz, was sent thither by the Holy Office of Cracow, the
people rose in defence of their leader and put the Inquisitor to death.
John of Pirna appears to have maintained his position, but after his
death the church enjoyed the pious satisfaction of exhuming his body,
burning it, and scattering the ashes to the winds.<a id="FNanchor_935_935" href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">935</a> It was easier to
do this than to destroy the leaven which was working everywhere in
men’s minds. No sooner were its manifestations repressed in one
quarter than they displayed themselves in another.</p>

<p>In the ineradicable corruption of the church, indeed, every effort
to purify it could only lead to a heresy. Except on the delicate
point of Transsubstantiation, Wickliffe proposed no doctrinal innovation,
but he keenly felt and energetically sought to repress the
disorders which had brought the church into disrepute. His scheme
swept away bishop, cardinal, and pope, the priesthood being the culminating
point in his system of ecclesiastical polity. The temporalities
which weighed down the spiritual aspirations of the church
were to be abandoned, and with them the train of abuses by which
the worldly ambition of churchmen was sustained—indulgences,
simony, image-worship, the power of excommunication, and the
thousand other arts by which the authority to bind and to loose had
been converted into broad acres or current coin of the realm. In
all this he was to a great extent a disciple of the Fraticelli, but his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
more practical mind escaped their leading error, and he denounced
as an intolerable abuse the beggary of the mendicant friars. Indeed,
the monastic orders in general were the objects of his special aversion,
as having no justification in the precepts of Christ, and his
repeated attacks upon them have a bitterness which shows not only
his deep-rooted aversion, but his sense of their importance as a bulwark
of the abuses which he assailed.<a id="FNanchor_936_936" href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">936</a> He reduced holy orders to
two—the priesthood and diaconate—but he maintained the indelible
character of ordination as separating the recipient from his fellows,
and he urged that all ministers of Christ should live in saintly poverty.<a id="FNanchor_937_937" href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">937</a>
All this was unreasonable enough in a perverse and stiff-necked
generation, but his unpardonable error was his revival of the
doctrine of Gregory VII. regarding the ministrations of unfaithful
priests, which he carried out resolutely to its logical consequences.<a id="FNanchor_938_938" href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">938</a>
According to him, a wicked priest could not perform his sacred
functions, and forfeited both his spiritualities and temporalities, of
which laymen were justified in depriving him. Nay more, priest
and bishop were no longer priest or bishop if they lived in mortal
sin, and his definition of mortal sin was such as to render it scarce
possible for any one to escape.<a id="FNanchor_939_939" href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">939</a></p>

<p>What his opinions were on the subject of clerical celibacy was a
mooted point even shortly after his death. Thomas of Walden, the
confessor of Henry V., in his <i>Doctrinale Fidei</i>, written to confute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
the errors of Lollardry, declares that he could not persuade himself
that the Wickliffites derived from their leader their opposition to
celibacy until he had recently read in Wickliffe’s Sermon on Midsummer
Eve the passage which says that “prestis ben dowid and
wyflees agens Goddis autorite.... And this is the caste of the
fend to kyndle fir in heerdis” &amp;c.,<a id="FNanchor_940_940" href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">940</a> and Mr. Arnold, the latest editor
of Wickliffe, seems to entertain no doubt as to the authenticity of
the text, or of the views of the reformer as expressed there, and
in other passages of tracts attributed to him.<a id="FNanchor_941_941" href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">941</a> Yet had Wickliffe
taught this doctrine it would have been as widely known as his other
errors, it would have been condemned in the repeated proceedings
taken against him and his teachings, and it would not have been left
for Thomas of Walden to discover it in one of the numerous sermons
which passed from hand to hand as the works of the heresiarch.
Wickliffe was too earnest and sincere in his convictions to leave anyone
in doubt as to his belief on any point that he thought worth
discussion.</p>

<p>What his views were on this subject can perhaps best be sought in
the most mature of his works, the Trialogus, the authenticity of
which I believe is indisputable. No one can read the chapters on
Sensuality and Chastity without seeing that the whole line of argument
is directed towards proving the superiority of virginity over
marriage, even to the fanciful etymology of “cœlibatus” from the
state of the “beati in cælo;” while in the chapter on the riches of
the clergy, they are regarded as virgins betrothed to Christ, and the
vow of chastity which they take is likened to their similar vow of
poverty, and not to be infringed.<a id="FNanchor_942_942" href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">942</a> Wickliffe’s austerity, in fact, was
deeply tinged with asceticism, and in aiming to restore the primitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
simplicity of the church, he had no thought of relegating its ministers
to the carnalities of family life, which would render impossible the
Apostolic poverty that was his ideal. Even the laity, in his scheme,
were to be so rendered superior to the lusts of the flesh that he pronounced
those who married from any other motive than that of
having offspring to be not truly married.<a id="FNanchor_943_943" href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">943</a> He evidently had no
intention to interfere with clerical celibacy, and the passages which
have been cited to the contrary may safely be regarded as supposititious.
Either the writings in which they occur have been erroneously
ascribed to Wickliffe, or the passages themselves have been interpolated
by too zealous disciples, eager to procure the authority of the
master for the later development of doctrines that were not his—a
pious fraud too common in all ages of the church to excite surprise.</p>

<p>It is easier to start a movement than to restrain it. Wickliffe
might deny the authority of tradition, and yet preserve his respect
for the tradition of celibacy, but his followers could not observe the
distinction. They could see, if he could not, that the structure of
sacerdotalism, to the overthrow of which he devoted himself, could
not be destroyed without abrogating the rule which separated the
priest from his fellow-men, and which severed all other ties in binding
him to the church. In 1394, only ten years after Wickliffe’s
death, the Lollards, by that time a powerful party, with strong
revolutionary tendencies, presented to Parliament a petition for the
thorough reformation of the church, containing twelve conclusions
indicating the points on which they desired change. Of these, the
third denounced the rule of celibacy as the cause of the worst disorders,
and argued the necessity of its abrogation; while the eleventh
attacked the vows of nuns as even more injurious, and demanded
permission for their marriage with but scanty show of respect.<a id="FNanchor_944_944" href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">944</a>
This became the received doctrine of the sect, for in a declaration
made in 1400 by Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury, concerning
the Lollard heresies, we find enumerated the belief that those in holy
orders could take to themselves wives without sin, and that monks
and nuns were at liberty to abandon their profession, and marry at
pleasure.<a id="FNanchor_945_945" href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">945</a></p>

<p>The fierce persecutions of Henry V., to repress what he rightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
considered as a formidable source of civil rebellion as well as heresy,
succeeded in depriving the sect of political power; yet its religious
doctrines still continued to exist among the people, and even sometimes
obtained public expression.<a id="FNanchor_946_946" href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">946</a> They unquestionably tended
strongly to shake the popular reverence for Rome, and had no little
influence in paving the way for the revolt of the sixteenth century.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>John Huss was rather a reformer than a heresiarch. Admirer
though he was of Wickliffe, even to the point of wishing to risk
damnation with him,<a id="FNanchor_947_947" href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">947</a> he avoided the doctrinal errors of the Englishman
on the subject of the Eucharist. Yet his predestinarian views
were unorthodox, and he shared in some degree Wickliffe’s Gregorian
ideas as to the effect of mortal sin in divesting the priesthood of all
claim to sacredness or respect. According to his enemies, he asserted
that no one could be the vicar of Christ or of Peter unless he were
an humble imitator of the virtues of him whom he claimed to represent;
and a pope who was given to avarice was only the representative
of Judas Iscariot.<a id="FNanchor_948_948" href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">948</a> His friend, Jerome of Prague, maintained
with his latest breath that Huss was thoroughly orthodox, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
only inspired by indignation at seeing the wealth of the church,
which was the patrimony of the poor, lavished on prostitutes, feasting,
hunting, rich apparel, and other unseemly extravagance.<a id="FNanchor_949_949" href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">949</a> In
the Bohemian clergy he had an ample target for his assaults, for they
were in no respect better than their neighbors. During the latter
half of the fourteenth century scarce a synod was held which did
not denounce their vices, gambling, drunkenness, usury, simony, and
concubinage; and when to put an end to the latter irregularity a
strict visitation was made throughout the archiepiscopal diocese of
Prague, the cunning rogues sent away or secreted their partners in
guilt, and openly recalled them as soon as the storm had passed.
The following year, Archbishop Sbinco peremptorily commanded that
all concubines should be dismissed within six days, under pain of
perpetual imprisonment, but this was evidently regarded as a mere
<i>brutum fulmen</i>, for the next year a new device was resorted to, by
pronouncing all concubinary priests to be heretics.<a id="FNanchor_950_950" href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">950</a> All this might
certainly seem to warrant any effort that might be made to accomplish
what the authorities so signally failed in doing, but that any individual
should assert the right of private judgment in reforming the
church in its head and its members threatened results too formidable
to the whole structure of sacerdotalism, and the condemnation of
Huss was inevitable. Still, like Wickliffe, he was a devout believer
in ascetic purity. His denunciations of the wealth and disorders of
the clergy raised so great an excitement throughout Bohemia that
King Wenceslas was forced to issue a decree depriving immoral
ecclesiastics of their revenues. The partisans of Huss took a lively
interest in the enforcement of this law, and brought the unhappy
ecclesiastics before the tribunals with a pertinacity which amounted
to the persecution of an inquisition.<a id="FNanchor_951_951" href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">951</a></p>

<p>Unlike the Lollards, the Hussites maintained the strictness of
their founder’s views on the subject of celibacy. If the fiercer
Taborites cruelly revenged their wrongs upon the religious orders, it
was to punish the minions of Rome, and not to manifest their contempt
for asceticism; and, at the same time, even the milder Calixtins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
treated all lapses from clerical virtue among themselves with a
severity which proved their sincerity and earnestness, and which had
long been a stranger to the administration of the church.<a id="FNanchor_952_952" href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">952</a> One of
the complaints against the priesthood formulated in the proclamation
of Procopius and the other chiefs in 1431, at the assembling of the
Council of Bâle, was that the clergy were all fornicators, committing
adultery with men’s wives, or having wives and “presbyterissæ” of
their own;<a id="FNanchor_953_953" href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">953</a> and when, in 1562, the Emperor Ferdinand endeavored
to procure from the Council of Trent the use of the cup for the
Utraquists or Calixtins of Bohemia, he urged in their favor that
they would not admit the ministrations of any priest who did not
lead a celibate life.<a id="FNanchor_954_954" href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">954</a> Traces of the teachings of the Fraticelli, moreover,
are to be found in the doctrines which dissevered temporal from
spiritual power, and denied to the clergy all ownership or dominion
over landed possessions.<a id="FNanchor_955_955" href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">955</a></p>

<p>The Hussite movement thus was an efficient protest against some
of the forms of sacerdotalism. The nominal reconciliation effected
by the Council of Bâle, against the wishes of the papacy, afforded
considerable scope for religious liberty, which was strengthened by
the alliance between Bohemia and Poland. The reigns of George
Podiebrad, Vlasdislav, and Louis, which extended from 1458 to 1525,
favored this spirit and prepared the soil for the rapid spread of
Lutheranism throughout those regions, which in the sixteenth century
narrowly escaped permanent separation from Catholic unity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span></p>

<p>One fragment of the Hussites, however, held wholly aloof from
reconciliation to Rome and professed to uphold in their purity the
doctrines of their founder. These called themselves the Orthodox
Brethren, but were stigmatized by their adversaries with the opprobrious
name of Picardi, in allusion to an obnoxious heresy of the
previous centuries. In process of time they admitted the validity of
priestly marriage, though it was discouraged among them in view of
the dangers to which they were exposed and the constant risk of
martyrdom incurred by all who ventured to be conspicuous among
them, for Hussite and Catholic alike sought their extermination.
Yet they bravely maintained their existence until the Reformation,
when they eagerly fraternized with Luther,<a id="FNanchor_956_956" href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">956</a> such minor differences
as existed in the organization of the respective churches being
amicably regulated in 1570 by the agreement of Sendomir.<a id="FNanchor_957_957" href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">957</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Wickliffe and Huss were not the only inheritors of the antisacerdotal
spirit of the Fraticelli. About the close of the fourteenth
century there arose in Thuringia a heresiarch of the flagellants named
Conrad Schmidt, whose teachings swept away the forms and observances
which had so thickly incrusted the simple doctrines of Christianity.
The sacrifice of the mass, image-worship, fasting, feasts,
purgatory, confession, and absolution, all fell before the fearless logic
of the reformer, and his disciples fondly treasured him in memory as
a second incarnation of Enoch. For forty years the sect flourished
in secret, but at length it was discovered in Misnia, where its
members were known as Brethren of the Cross, and where it was
exterminated in 1414 by the fagots of Sangerhausen. The licentious
doctrines attributed to them by the monkish chronicler show
that sacerdotal celibacy was one of the observances which they repudiated.<a id="FNanchor_958_958" href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">958</a>
Similar in its tendency, and almost identical in details,
was the heresy which, in 1411, was condemned in Flanders by Peter
d’Ailly, Archbishop of Cambrai. Giles Cantor, a layman, and a
Carmelite known as William of Hilderniss gathered around them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
followers who assumed the title of Men of Intelligence. Like Conrad
Schmidt, they rejected the empty formalism which had to so great an
extent usurped the place of religion. The Atonement had satisfied
God for all; there was no necessity for the intervention of sacerdotal
ministrations, for confession and absolution were useless, Christ was
not present in the sacrament, purgatory did not exist, and all mankind,
besides the fallen angels, would in the end be saved. There
was, however, little of the temper of martyrs about them, and a
public renunciation of their errors at Brussels speedily deprived them
of all importance.<a id="FNanchor_959_959" href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">959</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Savonarola can scarcely be classed among heretics. Though he
was tortured and put to death by the church for his rebellious
attempts to purify it, still his doctrines never varied from strict
orthodoxy, and Benedict XIV. even included him in a catalogue of
the holy servants of God.<a id="FNanchor_960_960" href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">960</a> Yet Savonarola, when his career was
cut short, was rapidly becoming a schismatic, as was inevitable with
all reformers of ardent temperament as soon as they discovered the
impossibility of removing the corruptions of the establishment. If,
instead of the fickle support of the Florentine populace, which betrayed
him at his utmost need, he had enjoyed the steadfast protection
of such a patron as the Elector Frederic of Saxony, he would
doubtless have ripened in time, as Luther subsequently did, into a
full-blown heresiarch, though his innate defects of character would
scarcely have enabled him, under any circumstances, to conduct successfully
so complicated a movement as a separation from the church.</p>

<p>The principal feature of his history which concerns us is the good-natured
indifference with which Alexander VI. endured his repeated
attacks on the scandals and vices of the papal court. There were so
many political interests entangled in Savonarola’s career that it is
not always easy to reach the hidden springs of action at work, but
it may be assumed that Alexander, if left to himself, would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
allowed the reformer to declaim unmolested. More than once he
interdicted the Dominican from preaching and ordered him to Rome,
but took little heed of disobedience. At length he launched an excommunication,
which for nearly a year received as little respect as
his previous orders, and when at length a sudden revulsion of feeling
among the Florentine mob enabled him to dispose of his adversary
under the forms of law, it is probable that even then he would not
have pushed matters to such extremity had not Savonarola been led
to an act of aggressive rebellion. The Duke of Milan forwarded to
the pope intercepted letters in which the reformer, by command of
God, urged the monarchs of Europe to call a general council under
pretext that the church was without a head, since Alexander was an
infidel who had obtained the tiara by simony and had polluted it
with unimaginable vices. In his capacity of prophet, Savonarola
promised the rulers triumph over their enemies if they would aid in
the good work of cleansing the church, and he engaged to prove
before the council the truth of his allegations by working miracles.<a id="FNanchor_961_961" href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">961</a>
It would probably be unjust to condemn him as an imposter, but
such conclusion is only to be escaped by pronouncing him partially
insane. That fierce age was not apt to invoke such considerations
in palliation of so flagrant an attempt at revolution, and Savonarola
was doomed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While thus trampling out these successive revolts, the church was
blind to the lesson taught by their perpetual recurrence. The minds
of men were gradually learning to estimate at its true value the claim
of the hierarchy to veneration, and at the same time the vices of the
establishment were yearly becoming more odious, and its oppression
more onerous. The explosion might be delayed by attempts at
partial reformation, but it was inevitable.</p>

<h2><a name="XXIV" id="XXIV">XXIV.</a><br />

THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.</h2>


<p>Neither the assaults of heretics nor the constant efforts at partial
reform attempted by individual prelates had thus far proved of any
avail. As time wore on, the church sank deeper into the mire of
corruption, and its struggles to extricate itself grew feebler and more
hopeless. We have seen that, early in the fifteenth century, Gerson
advised an organized system of concubinage as preferable to the indiscriminate
licentiousness which was everywhere prevalent. Even
more suggestive are the declarations of Nicholas de Clemanges,
Rector of the University of Paris and Secretary of Benedict XIII.
(Pedro de Luna). He does not hesitate to say that the vices of the
clergy were so universal that those who adhered to the rule of chastity
were the objects of the most degrading and disgusting suspicions, so
little faith was there in the possible purity of any ecclesiastic. He
also records the extension of a custom to which I have already
alluded when he states that in a majority of parishes the people
insisted on their pastors keeping concubines, and that even this was
a precaution insufficient for the peace and honor of their families.<a id="FNanchor_962_962" href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">962</a>
In another tract he describes the mass of the clergy as wholly abandoned
to worldly ambition and vices, oppressing and despoiling those
subjected to them and spending their ill-gotten gains in the vilest
excesses, while they ridiculed unsparingly such few pious souls as
endeavored to live according to the light of the gospel.<a id="FNanchor_963_963" href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">963</a> In most of
the dioceses the parish priests openly kept concubines, which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
were permitted to do on payment of a tax to their bishops. Nunneries
were brothels, and to take the veil was simply another mode
of becoming a public prostitute.<a id="FNanchor_964_964" href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">964</a> Cardinal Peter d’Ailly declares
that he does not dare to describe the immorality of the nunneries.<a id="FNanchor_965_965" href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">965</a>
In a similar indignant mood Gerson stigmatizes the nunneries of his
time as houses of prostitution, the monasteries as centres of trade and
amusement, the cathedral churches as dens of ravishers and robbers,
and the priesthood at large as habitual concubinarians.<a id="FNanchor_966_966" href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">966</a> That he
felt these evils to be inseparable from the condition of the church is
evident when, in an argument to prove the necessity of celibacy, he
is driven to the assertion that it is better to tolerate incontinent
priests than to have no priests at all.<a id="FNanchor_967_967" href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">967</a> He argues that the clergy
are worthy of as many sentences of damnation as they seduce souls
to perdition by their corrupt example, and he asks, when he who
destroys himself by his own sins is to be condemned, whether he
who draws with him numerous others is not still more worthy of
perdition.<a id="FNanchor_968_968" href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">968</a> Theodoric a Niem represents the bishops of Scandinavia
as carrying with them their concubines on their pastoral visitations,
and as inflicting penalties on such of the parish priests as they found
living without similar companions, while these women habitually
took precedence in church of the wives of the neighboring gentry—and
he adds that the clergy of the south of Europe were no better.<a id="FNanchor_969_969" href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">969</a>
Theodoric Vrie, a learned and pious churchman of Saxony, is
equally unsparing in his denunciations of the Teutonic clergy<a id="FNanchor_970_970" href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">970</a>—and,
indeed, the testimony of the writers of the period is so unanimous
that their descriptions of clerical vices cannot be regarded as
the mere rhetorical declamation of disappointed reformers.</p>

<p>It was evident that the efforts of local synods were fruitless to
eradicate evils so general and so deeply rooted, while the necessity
for some reform became every day more apparent. Though Lollardry
had been crushed in England under the stern hand of Henry V., yet
it was reappearing in Bohemia in a form even more threatening.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
The council of Pisa had not succeeded in healing the Great Schism,
and there arose a general demand for an Œcumenic Council in which
the church universal should assemble for the purpose of purifying
itself, of eradicating heresy, and of settling definitely the pretensions
of the three claimants of the papacy. John XXIII. yielded to the
pressure, and the call for the Council of Constance went forth in his
name and in that of the Emperor Sigismund.</p>

<p>So powerful a body had never before been gathered together in
Europe. It claimed to be the supreme representative of the church,
and though it acknowledged John XXIII. as the lawful successor of
St. Peter, it had no scruples in arraigning, trying, condemning, and
deposing him—an awful expression of its supremacy, without precedent
in the past, and without imitation in succeeding ages. As regards
heresy, it did the best it could, according to the lights of its
age, by burning John Huss and Jerome of Prague. Its functions
as a reformer, however, required for their exercise more nerve than
even the condemnation of a pope. Many members were thoroughly
penetrated with the conviction that reform was of instant necessity,
and such men as Gerson, Peter d’Ailly of Cambrai, and Nicholas
de Clemanges were prepared to shrink from none of the means requisite
for so hallowed an end. In the existing corruption, however, of
the body from which representatives were drawn, such men could
scarcely form a controlling majority. After the council had been in
session for nearly two years, the reformers began to despair of effecting
anything, and Clemanges did not hesitate to assert that nothing
was to be expected from men who would regard reform as the greatest
calamity that could befall themselves;<a id="FNanchor_971_971" href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">971</a> while another of the members
of the council declared that every one wanted such a reform as should
allow him to retain his own particular form of iniquity.<a id="FNanchor_972_972" href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">972</a> These estimates,
indeed, of the character of the majority of the good fathers
of Constance is borne out by the contemporary accounts of the multitudes
who flocked to it to ply their trades among the assembled
dignitaries of the church, showing that they were by no means all
devoted to mortifying the flesh.<a id="FNanchor_973_973" href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">973</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span></p>

<p>The feelings of those who sincerely desired reform, as they saw
the prospect rapidly fading before their eyes, may be estimated by a
sermon of a sturdy Gascon abbot, Bernhardus Baptisatus, preached
before the council in August, 1517, about three months before the
conservatives succeeded in carrying their point by electing Martin V.
He denounces the members of the council as Pharisees, falsely pretending
to be devout in order to elude the punishment due to their
crimes. The masses and processions, which were the main business
of the assemblage, he declares to be valueless in the eye of God, for
most of those who so busily took part in them were involved solely
in worldly cares, laughing, cheating, sleeping, or demoralizing the
rest with their ungodly conversation. The Holy Spirit did not hold
the acts of the council acceptable, nor dwell with its unrighteous
members.<a id="FNanchor_974_974" href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">974</a> Such a convocation could have but one result.</p>

<p>It is easy therefore to understand the influences that were brought
to bear to defeat the expectations of the reformers; how the subject
could be postponed until after the questions connected with the papacy
and with heresy were disposed of; and how, after the election of
Martin V., those who shrank from all reform could assume that it
might safely be intrusted to the hands of a pontiff so able, so energetic,
and so virtuous. In all this they were successful. The
council closed its weary sessions, April 22, 1418, and during its
three years and a half of labor it had only found leisure to regulate
the dress of ecclesiastics, the unclerical cut of whose sleeves was
especially distasteful to the representative body of Christendom.<a id="FNanchor_975_975" href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">975</a></p>

<p>Still, the reformers had made a stubborn fight, and had procured
the appointment of a commission to consider all reformatory propositions
and prepare a general scheme for the adoption of the council.
This body labored as diligently as though its deliberations were to
be crowned with practical results, and various projects of reform
proposed by it have been preserved. In one of these the severest
measures of repression were suggested to put an end to the scandal
of concubinage which was openly practised in the majority of dioceses.
Under this scheme, while all the canonical punishments heretofore
decreed were maintained in full vigor, deprivation was pronounced
against all holders of ecclesiastical preferment, from bishops
down, who should not within one month eject their guilty partners;
their positions were declared vacant <i>ipso jure</i>, and their successors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
were to be immediately appointed. Those who did not hold benefices
were similarly to be declared ineligible to preferment. It appears that
scandals had arisen in many places from the Hildebrandine and
Wickliffite heresy whereby parishioners declined the ministrations of
those who were living in open and notorious sin; and to avoid these,
while the commission declined to pass an opinion on the propriety of
such action, it advised that such private judgment should not be exercised.<a id="FNanchor_976_976" href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">976</a>
In another elaborate system of reform, which bears the marks of
long deliberation, the attempt was made to eradicate the long-standing
abuse of admitting to preferment the illegitimate children of ecclesiastics,
and it was declared that papal dispensations should no longer
be recognized except in cases of peculiar fitness or high rank.<a id="FNanchor_977_977" href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">977</a> The
same code of discipline struck a significant blow at the inviolability
of the monastic profession when it endeavored to check the prevailing
and deplorable licentiousness of the nunneries by decreeing that no
woman should be admitted to the vows beneath the age of twenty,
and that all vows taken at a younger age should be null and void.<a id="FNanchor_978_978" href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">978</a>
These projects are interesting merely as indicating the direction in
which the reforming portion of the church desired to move, and as
showing that even they did not propose to remove the celibacy which
was the chief cause of the evils they so sincerely deplored.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Martin V. had assumed the responsibility of reforming the church,
and he did, in fact, attempt it after some fashion, though he apparently
took to heart Dante’s axiom—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Lunga promessa, con l’attender corto</div>
  <div class="verse">Ti farà trionfar nell’ alto seggio.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In 1422 Cardinal Branda of Piacenza, his legate, when sent to
Germany to preach a crusade against the Hussites, was honored with
the title of Reformer General, and full powers were given to him to
effect this part of his mission. The letters-patent of the pope bear
ample testimony to the fearful depravity of the Teutonic church,<a id="FNanchor_979_979" href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">979</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
while the constitution which Branda promulgated declares that in a
portion of the priesthood there was scarcely left a trace of decency
or morality. According to this document, concubinage, simony,
neglect of sacred functions, gambling, drinking, fighting, buffoonery,
and kindred pursuits, were the prevalent vices of the ministers of
Christ; but the punishments which he enacted for their suppression—repetitions
of those which we have seen proclaimed so many times
before—were powerless to overcome the evils which had become part
and parcel of the church itself.<a id="FNanchor_980_980" href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">980</a></p>

<p>What was the condition of clerical morals in Italy soon after this
may be learned from a single instance. When Ambrose was made
General of the austere order of Camaldoli he set vigorously to work
to reform the laxity which had almost ruined it. One of his abbots
was noted for abounding licentiousness; not content with ordinary
amours, he was wont to visit the nunneries in his district to indulge
in promiscuous intercourse with the virgins dedicated to God. Yet
Ambrose in taking him to task did not venture to punish him for his
misdeeds, but promised him full pardon for the past and to take him
into favor, if he would only abstain for the future—a task which
ought to be easy as he was now old and should be content with having
long lived evilly and be ready to dedicate his few remaining years to
the service of God.<a id="FNanchor_981_981" href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">981</a> When a reformer, who enjoyed the special
friendship and protection of Eugenius IV., was forced to be so
moderate with such a criminal, it is easy to imagine what was the
tone of morality in the church at large.</p>

<p>While the Armagnacs and Burgundians were rivalling the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
in carrying desolation into every corner of France, it could not be
expected that the peaceful virtues could flourish, or sempiternal
corruption be reformed. Accordingly, it need not surprise us to see
Hardouin, Bishop of Angers, despondingly admit, in 1428, that
licentiousness had become so habitual among his clergy that it was
no longer reputed to be a sin; that concubinage was public and undisguised,
and that the patrimony of Christ was wasted in supporting
the guilty partners of the priesthood. That gambling, swearing,
drunkenness, and all manner of unclerical conduct should accompany
these disorders, is too probable to require the concurrent testimony
which the worthy bishop affords us.<a id="FNanchor_982_982" href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">982</a> Alain Chartier, Archdeacon
of Paris and Secretary to Charles VI. and Charles VII., confirms
this in a more general way, when he attributes to enforced celibacy
and the temporal endowments of the church the vices and crimes
which rendered the clergy so odious and contemptible to the laity
that he looks forward to the speedy advent of Antichrist to wipe out
the whole system in universal ruin.<a id="FNanchor_983_983" href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">983</a> Apparently its corruption was
too deep-seated to hope for any milder means of reformation. To this
we may at least partially attribute the utter loss of respect for sacred
things which rendered the churches and their pastors a special mark
for pillage and persecution during the dreary civil wars of the
period.<a id="FNanchor_984_984" href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">984</a></p>

<p>In England, which had enjoyed comparative immunity from civil
strife, matters were quite as bad. At the request of Henry V., in
1414, the University of Oxford prepared a series of articles for the
reformation of the church, whose shortcomings were vehemently
attacked by the Lollards. It is not easy to imagine a more humiliating
confession than is contained in the 38th article, directed against
priestly immorality. The carnal and undisguised profligacy of
ecclesiastics is declared to be a scandal to the church, and its impurity
to be a dangerous temptation to others. It is therefore recommended
that all public fornicators be suspended for a limited time from the
ministry of the altar, and that some corporal chastisement be inflicted
on them, in place of the trifling pecuniary mulct, which, levied in
secret, had no effect in deterring them from their evil courses.<a id="FNanchor_985_985" href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">985</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span></p>

<p>Such was the state of sacerdotal morals when the great council of
Bâle attracted to itself the hopes of Christendom as the sole instrument
by which the purification of the church could be effected—a
purification which was felt to be the only safeguard against a revolutionary
uprising of the indignant laity. When Eugenius IV.,
towards the close of the year 1431, dreading the antagonism between
the council and the papacy, sent his Bull ordering its dissolution, his
legate, Cardinal Cesarini, took the responsibility of refusing obedience.
His letter explaining the reasons of his contumacy affords a curious
picture of the internal condition of the church and of the relations
existing between it and the laity. The extreme corruption of
ecclesiastical morals had been the principal object of convoking the
council and had given rise to a feeling of fierce hostility towards the
church. To this was attributable the success which had attended
the Hussite movement, and unless the people could have reason to
anticipate amendment, there was ample cause to fear a general
imitation of the Hussites. So many provincial synods were daily
held without result that confidence was no longer felt in the ordinary
ecclesiastical machinery; the state of the public mind grew constantly
more threatening as fresh scandals were wrought by the clergy, and
the hopes entertained of the council were the only restraint which
prevented the breaking out of a wide-spread revolt. As a proof of
his assertions, the legate refers to various local troubles. Magdeburg
had expelled her archbishop and clergy, was preparing wagons with
which to fight, after the Bohemian fashion, and was said to have sent
for a Hussite to command her forces. Passau had revolted against
her bishop, and was even then laying close siege to his citadel.
Bamberg was engaged in a violent quarrel with her bishop and
chapter. These cities were regarded as the centres of formidable
secret confederacies, and were believed to be negotiating with the
Hussites.<a id="FNanchor_986_986" href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">986</a> The good fathers evidently recognized the full magnitude
of the danger. The results of the inaction of the Council of Constance
were full of pregnant warnings. The reformers could no
longer be brought to trust the papacy, and those who might secretly
deprecate reform were fully alive to the threatening aspect of affairs.
They therefore addressed themselves resolutely to the removal of the
cause. All who were guilty of public concubinage were ordered to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
dismiss their consorts within sixty days after the promulgation of the
canon, under pain of deprivation of revenue for three months.
Persistent contumacy or repetition of the offence was visited with
suspension from functions and stipend until satisfactory evidence
should be afforded of repentance and amendment. Bishops who
neglected to enforce the law were to be held as sharing the guilt
which they allowed to pass unpunished; and those prelates who were
above the jurisdiction of local tribunals or synods were to be remanded
to Rome for trial. The council deplored the extensive prevalence
of the “cullagium,” by which those to whom was entrusted
the administration of the church did not hesitate to enjoy a filthy
gain by selling licenses to sin. A curse was pronounced on all
involved in such transactions; they were to share the penalties of the
guilt which they encouraged, and were, in addition, to pay a fine of
double the amount of their iniquitous receipts.<a id="FNanchor_987_987" href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">987</a> In the Pragmatic
Sanction, moreover, agreed upon in 1438 between the Emperor
Albert II. and Charles VII. of France, the regulation confiscating
three months’ revenues of concubinary priests was embodied.<a id="FNanchor_988_988" href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">988</a></p>

<p>Honest, well-meant legislation this; yet the fathers of the council
or the princes of Christendom could hardly deceive themselves with
the expectation that it would prove effectual. If legislation could
accomplish the desired result, there had already been enough of it
since the days of Siricius. The compilations of canon law were full
of admirable regulations, by which generation after generation had
endeavored to attain the same object by every imaginable modification
of inquisition and penalty. Ingenuity had been exhausted in
devising laws which were only promulgated to be despised and forgotten.
Something more was wanting, and that something could not
be had without overturning the elaborate structure so skilfully and
laboriously built up by the craft and enthusiasm of ten centuries.</p>

<p>How utterly impotent, in fact, were the efforts of the council, is
evident when, within five years after the adoption of the Basilian
canons, Doctor Kokkius, in a sermon preached before the council of
Freysingen, could scarcely find words strong enough to denounce the
evil courses of the clergy as a class;<a id="FNanchor_989_989" href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">989</a> and when, within fifteen years,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
we find Nicholas V. declaring that the clergy enjoyed such immunity
that they scarcely regarded incontinence as a sin—a declaration sustained
by the regulations promulgated for the restraint of the officials
of his own court, which imply the previous open and undisguised
defiance of the canons.<a id="FNanchor_990_990" href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">990</a></p>

<p>Even in this attempt of Nicholas, however, is to be seen one of the
causes which perpetuated the corruption of the church. He orders
that all who thereafter persist in keeping concubines in defiance of
the regulations shall be incapable of receiving benefices without
special letters of indulgence from the Holy See.<a id="FNanchor_991_991" href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">991</a> Shrouded under a
thin veil of formality, this in substance indicates the degrading source
of revenue which was so energetically condemned in inferior officials.
The pressing and insatiable pecuniary needs of the papal court,
indeed, rendered it impotent as a reformer, however honest the
wearer of the tiara might himself be in desiring to rescue the church
from its infamy. Reckless expenditure and universal venality were
insuperable obstacles to any comprehensive and effective measures of
reformation. Every one was preoccupied either in devising or in
resisting extortion. The local synods were engaged in quarrelling
over the subsidies demanded by Rome, while the chronicles of the
period are filled with complaints of the indulgences sold year after
year to raise money for various purposes. Sometimes the objects
alleged are indignantly declared to be purely supposititious; at other
times intimations are thrown out that the collections were diverted to
the private gain of the popes and of their creatures.<a id="FNanchor_992_992" href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">992</a> The opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
which the church in general entertained of the papal court is manifested
with sufficient distinctness in a letter from Ernest, Archbishop
of Magdeburg, to his ambassador at Rome. The prelate states that
he has deposited five hundred florins in Fugger’s bank at Augsburg,
for which he desires to procure certain bulls, one to enable him to
sell indulgences, the other to compel the chapter of Magdeburg to
allow him to dispose of the salt-works of Halle, in defiance of the
vested rights of his church—thus taking for granted a cynicism of
venality which it would be difficult to parallel in the secular affairs
of the most corrupt of courts.<a id="FNanchor_993_993" href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">993</a> Even the power to dispense from
the vow of continence was occasionally turned to account in this
manner. One of the accusations against John XXIII. was that for
600 ducats he had released Jacques de Vitry, a Hospitaller, from his
vows, had restored him to the world, and enabled him to marry.<a id="FNanchor_994_994" href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">994</a>
In fact, when a pope like Sixtus IV. was found who openly sold all
preferment, who kept a regular scale for every grade from the cardinalate
downwards, and who only varied from his fixed prices by
putting up at auction some choice benefice,<a id="FNanchor_995_995" href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">995</a> it can hardly be expected
that discipline could be enforced or the ideal of chastity realized.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The aspirations of Christendom had culminated in the council of
Bâle in the most potent form known to the church universal. If
the results were scarce perceptible while the influences of the council
were yet recent, and while the antagonistic papacy was under the
control of men sincerely desirous to promote the best interests of
the church, such as Nicholas V. and Pius II., we can feel no wonder,
if the darkness continued to grow thicker and deeper under the rule
of such pontiffs as Sixtus IV., Innocent VIII., and Alexander VI.
Savonarola found an inexhaustible subject of declamation in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
fearful vices of the ecclesiastics of his times, whom he describes as
<i>ruffiani e mezzani</i>.<a id="FNanchor_996_996" href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">996</a> In the kingdom of Naples the state sought to
share with the church in the profits of impurity, and a regular tax
was laid upon the concubines of ecclesiastics. In a document still
preserved in the Neapolitan archives, Alfonso I. complains that this
tax had not been paid for three years, and directs his bishops to
compel its collection in their several dioceses.<a id="FNanchor_997_997" href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">997</a> In the assembly of
the Trois États of France, held at Tours in 1484, the orator of the
Estates, Jean de Rély, afterwards Bishop of Angers, in his official
address to Charles VIII., declared it to be notorious that the religious
orders had lost all devotion, discipline, and obedience to their rule,
while the canons (and he was himself a canon of Paris) had sunk
far below the laity in their morals, to the great scandal of the church.<a id="FNanchor_998_998" href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">998</a></p>

<p>In England, the facts developed by the examination which Innocent
VIII. in 1489 authorized Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury,
to make into the condition of the religious houses, present a state of
affairs quite as bad. Henry VII.’s first Parliament, in 1485, had
endeavored to accomplish some reform by passing an Act empowering
the episcopal authorities to imprison all priests and monks convicted
of carnal lapses,<a id="FNanchor_999_999" href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">999</a> but this, like all similar legislation, whether
secular or ecclesiastical, appears to have been useless. Innocent
describes the monasteries, in his bull to the archbishop, as wholly
fallen from their original discipline, and this is folly confirmed by
the results of the visitation. The old and wealthy abbey of St.
Albans, for instance, was little more than a den of prostitutes, with
whom the monks lived openly and avowedly. In two priories under
its jurisdiction the nuns had been turned out and their places filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
with courtezans, to whom the monks of St. Albans publicly resorted,
indulging in all manner of shameless and riotous living, the details
of which can well be spared.<a id="FNanchor_1000_1000" href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">1000</a> These irregularities were emulated
by the secular ecclesiastics. Among the records of the reign of
Henry VII. is a memorial from the gentlemen and farmers of
Carnarvonshire, complaining that the seduction of their wives and
daughters was pursued systematically by the clergy.<a id="FNanchor_1001_1001" href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">1001</a> That the
prevalence of these practices was thoroughly understood is shown in
a book of instructions for parish priests drawn up by a canon of
Lilleshall about this period. In enumerating the causes for which a
parson may shrive a man not of his own parish, he includes the case
in which the penitent has committed sin with the concubine or
daughter of his own parish priest.<a id="FNanchor_1002_1002" href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">1002</a></p>

<p>Spain was equally infected. The council of Aranda, in 1473,
denounced bitterly the evil courses by which the clergy earned for
themselves the wrath of God and the contempt of man, and it endeavored
to suppress the sempiternal vice by the means which had
been so often ineffectually tried—visitations, fines, excommunication,
suspension, forfeiture of benefice, and imprisonment—but all to as
little purpose as before.<a id="FNanchor_1003_1003" href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">1003</a> The trouble continued without abatement
and the council of Seville, in 1512, felt itself obliged to repeat as
usual all the old denunciations and penalties, including those against
ecclesiastics who officiated at the marriages of their children, which
it prohibited for the future under a fine of 2000 maravedis—a
mulct which it likewise provided for those who committed the indecency
of having their children as assistants in the solemnity of the
Mass.<a id="FNanchor_1004_1004" href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">1004</a></p>

<p>What was the condition of morals in Germany may be inferred
from some proceedings of the chapter of Brunswick in 1476. The
canons intimate that the commission of scandals and crimes has
reached a point at which there is danger of their losing the inesti<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>mable
privilege of exemption from episcopal jurisdiction. They
therefore declare that for the future the canons, vicars, and officiating
clergy ought not to keep their mistresses and concubines publicly in
their houses, or live with them within the bounds of the church, and
those who persist in doing so after three warnings shall be suspended
from their prebends until they render due satisfaction.<a id="FNanchor_1005_1005" href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">1005</a> In this
curious glimpse into the domestic life of the cathedral close, it is
evident that the worthy canons were moved by no shame for the publicity
of their guilt, but only by a wholesome dread of giving to their
bishop an excuse for procuring the forfeiture of their dearly prized
right of self-judgment.</p>

<p>The Hungarian church, by a canon dating as far back as 1382,
had finally adopted a pecuniary mulct as the most efficacious mode of
correcting offenders. The fine was five marks of current coin, and
by granting one-half to the informer or archdeacon, and the other to
the archiepiscopal chamber, it was reasonably hoped that the rule
might be enforced. The guardians were not faithful, however, for
two synods of Gran, one in 1450 and the other in 1480, reiterate
the complaint, not only that the archdeacons and other officials kept
the whole fine to themselves, but also, what was even worse, that
they permitted the criminals to persevere in sin, in order to make
money by allowing them to go unpunished.<a id="FNanchor_1006_1006" href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">1006</a> This state of affairs
was not to be wondered at if the description of his prelates by
Matthias Corvinus be correct. They were worldly princes, whose
energies were devoted to wringing from their flocks fabulous revenues
to be squandered in riotous living on the hordes of cooks and concubines
who pandered to their appetites.<a id="FNanchor_1007_1007" href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">1007</a> The morals of the regular
clergy were no better, for a Diet held by Vladislas II. in 1498 complained
of the manner in which abbots and other monastic dignitaries
enriched themselves from the revenues of their offices, and then,
returning to the world, publicly took wives, to the disgrace of their
order.<a id="FNanchor_1008_1008" href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">1008</a></p>

<p>In Pomerania the evil had at length partially cured itself, for the
female companions of the clergy seem to have been regarded as wives
in all but the blessing of the church. Benedict, Bishop of Camin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
in 1492, held a synod in which he quaintly but vehemently objurgates
his ecclesiastics for this wickedness; declares that no man can
part such couples joined by the devil; alludes to their offspring as
beasts creeping over the earth, and has his spleen peculiarly stirred
by the cloths of Leyden and costly ornaments with which the fair
sinners were bedecked, to the scandal of honest women.<a id="FNanchor_1009_1009" href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">1009</a> His indignation
was wasted on a hardened generation, for his successor, Bishop
Martin, on his accession to the see in 1499, found the custom still
unchecked. The new bishop promptly summoned a synod at Sitten
in 1500, where he reiterated the complaints of Benedict, adding that
the priests convert the patrimony of Christ into marriage portions
for their children, and procure the transmission of benefices from
father to son, as though glorying in the perpetuation of their shame.
What peculiarly exasperated the good prelate was that the place of
honor was accorded as a matter of course to the priests and their
consorts at all the merry-makings and festivities of their parishioners,
which shows how fully these unions were recognized as legitimate,
and, apparently, for prudential reasons, encouraged by the people.<a id="FNanchor_1010_1010" href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">1010</a></p>

<p>Similar customs, or worse, doubtless prevailed in Sleswick, for
when Eggard was consecrated bishop in 1494, he signalized the commencement
of his episcopate by forbidding his clergy to keep such
female companions. The result was that before the year expired he
was forced to abandon his see, and five years later he died, a
miserable exile in Rome.<a id="FNanchor_1011_1011" href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">1011</a></p>

<p>The monastic orders were no better than the secular clergy. When
Ximenes was made Provincial of the Franciscan order in Spain, he
set himself earnestly at work to force the brethren to live according
to the Rule. A large portion of them, known as Claustrals, led
disorderly lives, almost purely secular, and refused absolutely to
submit to the observance of their vows. King Ferdinand being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
appealed to pronounced sentence of banishment upon them, and they
absolutely preferred existence in exile to the insupportable yoke of
their Order. Yet they considered themselves so aggrieved that when
they left Toledo they marched in procession through the Puerta
Visagra with a crucifix at their head, singing the 113th Psalm “In
exitu Israel de Egypto.” When Ximenes was promoted to the
primatial see of Toledo, the malcontents appealed to the Vicar
General of the Order in Rome, who came to Spain and warmly
espoused their cause, being only forced to desist by the decided stand
taken by Queen Isabella in favor of Ximenes.<a id="FNanchor_1012_1012" href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">1012</a> It was the same
with the other monastic orders. A bull of Alexander VI., issued in
1496 for the purpose of reforming the Benedictines, describes the
inhabitants of many establishments of both sexes in that ancient and
honored institution as indulging in the most shameless profligacy;
and marriage itself was apparently not infrequently practised.<a id="FNanchor_1013_1013" href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">1013</a>
Savonarola did not hesitate to declare that nuns in their convents
became worse than harlots.<a id="FNanchor_1014_1014" href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">1014</a> Even the strictest of all the orders—the
Cistercian—yielded to the prevailing laxity. A general chapter,
held in 1516, denounces the intolerable abuse indulged in by some
abbots who threw off all obedience to the rule, and dared to keep
women under pretence of requiring their domestic services.<a id="FNanchor_1015_1015" href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">1015</a> To
fully appreciate the force of this indication, it is requisite to bear in
mind the stringency of the regulations which forbade the foot of
woman to pollute the sacred retirement of the Cistercian monasteries.<a id="FNanchor_1016_1016" href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">1016</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span></p>

<p>The efforts constantly made to check these abuses produced little
result. A Carthusian monk, writing in 1489, deplores the fact that
while monasteries were everywhere being reformed, few if any of
them maintained their morals, but returned to their old condition
immediately on the death of the zealous fathers who had sought to
improve them.<a id="FNanchor_1017_1017" href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">1017</a> That condition is described by a Benedictine Abbot,
the celebrated Trithemius, in general terms, as that of dens in which
it was a crime to be without sin, their inhabitants for the most part
being addicted to all manner of vices, and being monks only in name
and vestment.<a id="FNanchor_1018_1018" href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">1018</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span></p>

<p>That the clergy, as a body, had become a stench in the nostrils of
the people is evident from the immense applause which greeted all
attacks upon them. In 1476 a rustic prophet arose in the hamlet of
Niklaushausen, in the diocese of Wurzburg, who was a fit precursor
of Muncer and John of Leyden. John of Niklaushausen was a
swineherd, who professed himself inspired by the Virgin Mary.
From the Rhine-lands to Misnia, and from Saxony to Bavaria, immense
multitudes flocked to hear him, so that at times he preached
to crowds of twenty and thirty thousand men. His doctrines were
revolutionary, for he denounced oppression both secular and clerical;
but he was particularly severe upon the vices of the ecclesiastical
body. A special revelation of the Virgin had informed him that
God could no longer endure them, and that the world could not,
without a speedy reformation, be saved from the divine wrath consequent
upon them.<a id="FNanchor_1019_1019" href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">1019</a> The unfortunate man was seized by the Bishop
of Wurzburg; the fanatical zeal of his unarmed followers was easily
subdued, and he expiated at the stake his revolt against the powers
that were.</p>

<p>Such being the state of ecclesiastical morality throughout Europe,
there can be little wonder if reflecting men sought occasionally to
reform it in the only rational manner—not by an endless iteration of
canons, obsolete as soon as published, or by ingeniously varied
penalties, easily evaded or compounded—but by restoring to the
minister of Christ the right to indulge legitimately the affections
which bigotry might pervert, but could never eradicate. Even as
early as the close of the thirteenth century, the high authority of
Bishop William Durand had acknowledged the inefficacy of penal
legislation, and had suggested the discipline of the Greek church as
affording a remedy worthy of consideration.<a id="FNanchor_1020_1020" href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">1020</a> As the depravity of
the church increased, and as the minds of men gradually awoke from
the slumber of the dark ages, and shook off the blind reverence for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
tradition, the suggestion presented itself with renewed force. At
the council of Constance Cardinal Zabarella did not hesitate to suggest
that if the concubinary practices of the clergy could not be
suppressed it would be better to concede to them the privilege of
marriage,<a id="FNanchor_1021_1021" href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">1021</a> and shortly after the failure of the council to effect a
reform had became apparent, Guillaume Saignet wrote a tract entitled
“Lamentatio ob Cælibatum Sacerdotum” in which he attacked
the existing system, and called forth a rejoinder from Gerson. When
the council of Bâle was earnestly engaged in the endeavor to restore
forgotten discipline, the Emperor Sigismund laid before it a formula
of reformation which embraced the restoration of marriage to the
clergy. His orator drew a fearful picture of the evils caused by the
rule of celibacy—evils acknowledged by every one in the assembly—and
urged that as it had produced more injury than benefit, the
wiser course would be to follow the example of the Greek church.<a id="FNanchor_1022_1022" href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">1022</a>
A majority of the council assented to the principle, but shrank from
the bold step of adopting it. Eugenius IV. had just been forced to
acknowledge the legitimacy of the body as an œcumenic council; the
strife with the papacy might again break forth at any moment, and
it was not politic to venture on innovations too audacious. The conservatives,
therefore, skilfully eluded the question by postponing it
to a more favorable time, and the postponement was fatal.</p>

<p>One of the most celebrated members of the council, Cardinal
Nicholas Tudeschi, surnamed Panormitanus, whose preëminence as
an expounder of the canon law won for him the titles of “Canonistarum
Princeps” and “Lucerna Juris,” declared that the celibacy of
the clergy was not essential to ordination or enjoined by divine law;
and he records his unhesitating opinion that the question should be
left to the option of the individual—those who had resolution to preserve
their purity being the most worthy, while those who had not
would be spared the guilt which disgraced them.<a id="FNanchor_1023_1023" href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">1023</a> So Æneas Sylvius,
who as Pius II. filled the pontifical throne from 1458 to 1464, and
who knew by experience how easy it was to yield to the temptations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
of the flesh, is reported to have said that marriage had been denied
to priests for good and sufficient reasons, but that still stronger ones
now required its restoration.<a id="FNanchor_1024_1024" href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">1024</a> Indeed, when arguing before the
Council of Bâle in favor of the election of Amedeus of Savoy to the
papacy, he had not scrupled to declare that a married priesthood
would be the salvation of many who were damned in celibacy.<a id="FNanchor_1025_1025" href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">1025</a>
And we have already seen that Eugenius IV., in 1441, and Alexander
VI., in 1496, granted permission of marriage to several
military orders, as the only mode of removing the scandalous license
prevailing among them.</p>

<p>This question of the power of the pope to dispense with the
necessity of celibacy seems to have attracted some attention about
this period. In 1505, Geoffroy Boussard, afterwards Chancellor of
the University of Paris, published a tract wherein he argued that
priestly continence was simply a human and not a divine ordinance,
and that the pope was fully empowered to relax the rule in special
cases, though he could not abolish wholly an institution of such long
continuance which had received the assent of so many holy fathers
and general councils. At the same time, one of his arguments in
favor of its enforcement shows how little respect was left in the minds
of all thinking men for the claims of the church to veneration. He
quotes Bonaventura to the effect that if bishops and archbishops had
license to marry they would rob the church of all its property, and
none would be left for the poor, for, he adds, “since already they
seize the goods of the church for the benefit of distant relatives, what
would they not do if they had legitimate children of their own?”<a id="FNanchor_1026_1026" href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">1026</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the advantages and the necessity of celibacy thus were
doubted by the highest authorities in the church, it is no wonder if
those who were disposed to question the traditions of the past were
led to reject it altogether. In 1479 John Burckhardt, of Oberwesel,
graduate of Tubingen, and Doctor of Theology, in his capacity of
preacher at Worms, openly disseminated doctrines which differed in
the main but little from those of Wickliffe and Huss. He denied
the authority of popes, councils, and the fathers of the church to
regulate matters either of faith or discipline. The Scripture was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
only standard, and no one had a right to interpret it for his brethren.
The received observances of religion, prayers, fasts, indulgences,
were all swept away, and universal liberty of conscience proclaimed
to all. Of course, sacerdotal celibacy shared the same fate, as a
superstitious observance, contrived by papal ingenuity in opposition
to evangelical simplicity.<a id="FNanchor_1027_1027" href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">1027</a> Thus his intrepid logic far outstripped
the views of his predecessors, and Luther afterwards acknowledged
the similarity between his teachings and those of John of Oberwesel.
Yet he had not the spirit of martyrdom, and the Inquisition speedily
forced him to a recantation, which was of little avail, for he soon
after perished miserably in the dungeon in which he had been thrust.<a id="FNanchor_1028_1028" href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">1028</a></p>

<p>Still more remarkable as an indication of the growing spirit of independence
was an event which in July, 1485, disturbed the stagnation
of the centre of theological orthodoxy—the Sorbonne. A
certain Jean Laillier, priest and licentiate in theology, aspiring to
the doctorate, prepared his thesis or “Sorbonique,” in which he
broached various propositions savoring strongly of extreme Lollardry.
He denied the supremacy of the pope, and indeed reduced the
hierarchy to the level of simple priesthood; he rejected confession,
absolution, and indulgences; he refused to acknowledge the authority
of tradition and legends, and insisted that the fasts enjoined by the
church had no claim to observance. Celibacy was not likely to
escape so audacious an inquirer, and accordingly, among his postulates
were three, declaring that a priest clandestinely married
required no penitence; that the Eastern clergy committed no sin in
marrying, nor would the priests of the Western church, if they were
to follow the example; and that celibacy originated in 1073, in the
decretals of Gregory VII., whose power to introduce the rule he
more than questioned. The Sorbonne, as might be anticipated,
refused the doctorate to so rank a heretic, and Laillier had the boldness
not only to preach his doctrines publicly, but even to appeal to
the Parlement for the purpose of forcing his admission to the
Sorbonne. The Parlement referred the matter to the Bishop of
Paris and to the Inquisitor; Laillier’s audacity failed him, and he
agreed to recant.<a id="FNanchor_1029_1029" href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">1029</a> In Poland, too, there were symptoms of similar
revolt against the established ordinances of the church, as shown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
in a book published at Cracow in 1504, “De Matrimonia Sacerdotum.”<a id="FNanchor_1030_1030" href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">1030</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The corruption of the church establishment, in fact, had reached
a point which the dawning enlightenment of the age could not much
longer endure. The power which had been intrusted to it, when it
was the only representative of culture and progress, had been devoted
to selfish purposes, and had become the instrument of unmitigated
oppression in all the details of daily life. The immunity which had
been necessary to its existence through centuries of anarchy had
become the shield of unimaginable vices. The wealth, so freely
lavished upon it by the veneration of Christendom, was wasted in
the vilest excesses. All efforts at reformation from within had failed;
all attempts at reformation from without had been successfully
crushed and sternly punished. Intoxicated with centuries of domination,
the muttered thunders of growing popular discontent were
unheeded, and its claims to spiritual and temporal authority were
asserted with increasing vehemence, while its corruptions were daily
displayed before the people with more careless cynicism. There
appeared to be no desire on the part of the great body of the clergy
to make even a pretence of the virtue and piety on which were
based their claims for reverence, while the laity were daily growing
less reverent, were rising in intelligence, and were becoming more
inclined to question where their fathers had been content to believe.
Such a complication could have but one result.</p>

<h2><a name="XXV" id="XXV">XXV.</a><br />

THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY.</h2>


<p>The opening of the sixteenth century witnessed an ominous
breaking down of the landmarks of thought. The revival of letters,
which was fast rendering learning the privilege of all men in place
of the special province of the legal and clerical professions; the discovery
of America, which destroyed reverence for primæval tradition,
and accustomed men’s minds to the idea that startling novelties
might yet be truths; the invention of printing, which placed within
the reach of all inquirers who had a tincture of education the sacred
writings for investigation and interpretation and enabled the thinker
and the innovator at once to command an audience and disseminate
his views in remote regions; the European wars, commencing with
the Neapolitan conquest of Charles VIII., which brought the nations
into closer contact with each other, and carried the seeds of culture,
civilization, and unbelief from Italy to the farthest Thule; all these
causes, with others less notable, had been silently but effectually
wearing out the remnants of that pious and unquestioning veneration
which for ages had lain like a spell on the human mind.</p>

<p>In this bustling movement of politics and commerce, arts and
arms, science and letters, religion could not expect to escape the
spirit of universal inquiry. Even before opinion had advanced far
enough to justify examination into doctrinal points and dogmas, there
was a general readiness to regard the shortcomings of sacerdotalism,
in the administration of its sacred trust, with a freedom of criticism
which could not long fail to destroy the respect for claims of irrefragable
authority. John of England and the Emperor Otho might
gratify individual spite, in the intoxication of anticipated triumph,
by insultingly defying the sacerdotal power. Philippe-le-Bel, a man
far in advance of his age, might reduce the papacy to temporary
subjection by means of rare instruments such as Guillaume de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
Nogaret. Philippe de Valois, with the aid of his civil lawyers,
might essay to limit the extent of ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Wickliffe,
and Huss, and Savonarola might raise the standard of opposition
to papal usurpation—but these were sporadic instances of
rebellion, resulting either from the selfish ambition of rulers or the
fanatical enthusiasm of individuals, unsupported by the concurrent
opinion of the masses of the people, and their permanent results
were rather remote than direct. At the period to which we have
arrived, however, the disposition to criticise the abuses of the ecclesiastical
system, to note its shortcomings, and to apply remedial
measures was general, and savored little of the respect which an
infallible church had for so many centuries inculcated as one of the
first of Christian duties. Its past services were forgotten in present
wrongs. Its pretensions had, at one time, enabled it to be the protector
of the feeble, and the sole defence of the helpless; but that
time had passed. Settled institutions were fast replacing anarchy
throughout Europe, and its all-pervading authority would no longer
have been in place, even if exercised for the common benefit. When
it was notorious, however, that the powers and immunities claimed
by the church were everywhere employed for the vilest ends, their
anachronism became too palpable, and their destruction was only a
question of time.</p>

<p>Signs of the coming storm were not wanting. In 1510 a series
of complaints against the tyranny and extortion of Rome was solemnly
presented to the emperor. The German churches, it was
asserted, were confided by the successors of St. Peter to the care of
those who were better fitted to be keepers of mules than pastors of
men, and the pope was significantly told that he should act more
tenderly and kindly to his children of Teutonic race, lest there
might arise a persecution against the priesthood, or a general defection
from the Holy See, after the manner of the Hussites.<a id="FNanchor_1031_1031" href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">1031</a> The
emperor was warned, in his efforts to obtain the desired reform, not
to incur the censures and enmity of the pope, in terms which show
that only the political effects of excommunication were dreaded, and
that its spiritual thunders had lost their terrors. He was further
cautioned against the prelates in general, and the mendicant friars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
in particular, in a manner denoting how little reverence was left for
them in the popular mind, and how thoroughly the whole ecclesiastical
system had become a burden and reproach, a thing of the
past, an excrescence on society, and no longer an integral part of
every man’s life, and the great motive power of Christendom.<a id="FNanchor_1032_1032" href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">1032</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was evident that the age was rapidly outstripping the church,
and that the latter, to maintain its influence and position, must conform
to the necessities of progress and enlightenment. On previous
occasions it had done so, and had, with marvellous tact and readiness,
adapted itself to the exigencies of the situation in the long
series of vicissitudes which had ended by placing it supreme over
Europe. But centuries of almost uninterrupted prosperity had
hardened it. The corruption which attends upon wealth had rendered
wealth a necessity, and that wealth could only be had by perpetuating
and increasing the abuses which caused ominous murmurs
of discontent in those nations not fortunate enough to be defended
by Concordats or Pragmatic Sanctions. The church had lost its
suppleness, and was immovable. A reform such as was demanded,
while increasing its influence over the souls of men, would have
deprived it of control over their purses; reform meant poverty.
The sumpter-mule loaded with gold, wrung from the humble pittance
of the Westphalian peasant, under pretext of prosecuting the war
against the infidel, would no longer cross the Alps to stimulate with
its treasure the mighty genius of Michael Angelo, or the fascinating
tenderness of Raphael; to provide princely revenues for the bastards
of a pope, or to pay mercenaries who were to win them cities and
lordships; to fill the antechamber of a cardinal with parasites, and
to deck his mistresses with the silks and jewels of Ind; to feed needy
men of letters and scurrilous poets; to soothe the itching palms of
the Rota, and to enable all Rome to live on the tribute so cunningly
exacted of the barbarian.<a id="FNanchor_1033_1033" href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">1033</a> The wretched ending of the council of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
Bâle rendered any internal reformation impossible which did not
derive its initiative and inspiration from Rome, as was shown by the
failure of the council of Pisa. In Rome, it would have required
the energy of Hildebrand, the stern self-reliance of Innocent, the
unworldly asceticism of Celestin combined, to even essay a reform
which threatened destruction so complete to all the interests accumulated
by sacerdotalism around the Eternal City. Leo X. was neither
Hildebrand, nor Innocent, nor Celestin. With his voluptuous nature,
elegant culture, and easy temper, it is no wonder that he failed to
read aright the signs of the times, and that he did not even recognize
the necessity which should impose upon him a task so utterly
beyond his powers. The fifth council of Lateran had no practical
result. Blindly he plunged on; money must be had at any cost,
until the salvation mongering of Tetzel, little if any worse than that
of his predecessors, could no longer bear the critical spirit of the
age, and Teutonic insubordination at length found a mouth-piece in
the Monk of Wittenberg.</p>

<p>It would be a mistake to credit Luther with the Reformation.
His bold spirit and masculine character gave to him the front place,
and drew around him the less daring minds who were glad to have
a leader to whom to refer their doubts, and on whom their responsibility
might partly rest; yet Luther was but the exponent of a public
sentiment which had long been gaining strength, and which in any
case would not have lacked expression. In that great movement of
the human mind he was not the cause, but the instrument. Had his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
great opponent Erasmus enjoyed the physical vigor and practical
boldness of Luther, he would have been handed down as the heresiarch
of the sixteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_1034_1034" href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">1034</a> He, too, had borne his full share
in preparing the minds of men for what was to come. The whole
structure of sacerdotalism felt the blows of his irreverential spirit,
which boldly declared that the Scriptures alone contained what was
necessary to salvation.<a id="FNanchor_1035_1035" href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">1035</a> Theological subtleties and priestly observances
were alike useless or worse than useless. For the living, it
was idle to attend mass; for the dead, it was folly to look to such a
means for extrication from purgatory.<a id="FNanchor_1036_1036" href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">1036</a> The confessional was to be
visited only as a formal prerequisite to partaking the Eucharist;<a id="FNanchor_1037_1037" href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">1037</a>
pilgrimages and the veneration of relics were ridiculed with a reckless
freedom which showed that the advance of enlightenment had
utterly destroyed the reverence of the past.<a id="FNanchor_1038_1038" href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">1038</a> Nothing, indeed, can
give us a more thorough conviction of the readiness of the public to
welcome a radical change than the wealth of indignant bitterness
which Erasmus, himself a canon regular and a priest, heaps upon all
orders of the church, and the immense applause which everywhere
greeted his attacks. His sarcastic humor, his biting satire, his exquisite
ridicule, nowhere find a more congenial subject than the
vices of the monks, the priests, the prelates, the cardinals, and even
of the pope himself, until even Luther, as late as 1517, feels con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>strained
to deplore that the evils which afflicted the church should
be thus exposed to derision.<a id="FNanchor_1039_1039" href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">1039</a> It affords a curious illustration of the
times to read those writings which a century earlier would have consigned
him to the dungeon or the stake, and to reflect that he was
not only the admiration of both the learned and the vulgar of Europe,
but also the petted protégé of king and kaisar, the correspondent of
popes, and finally the champion of the system which he had so ruthlessly
reviled, and which he never ceased to deplore.<a id="FNanchor_1040_1040" href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">1040</a> The extraordinary
favor with which his works were received by all classes
shows how fully he was justified in the indignation which he so unsparingly
lavished on clerical abuses, and how eagerly the public
appreciated one who could so well express that which was felt by all.
Equally significant was the popularity of the “Epistolæ Obscurorum
Virorum,” in which the learned wits of the new school poured forth
upon the clergy a broad and homely ridicule which exactly suited
the taste of the age;<a id="FNanchor_1041_1041" href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">1041</a> while Cornelius Agrippa more than rivalled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
Erasmus in the wealth of vigorous denunciation with which he
lashed the vices of all the orders of ecclesiastics, from the pope to
the béguine.<a id="FNanchor_1042_1042" href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">1042</a></p>

<p>Not less indicative of the dangerous state of opinion was an
address delivered in the Diet held at Augsburg in 1518, when the
legates of Leo X. appealed to Germany for a tithe to assist in carrying
on the war against the Turk. The orator who replied to them
did not restrain his indignation at the deplorable condition of the
church, which he attributed solely to the worldly ambition of the
popes. Since they had united temporal with spiritual dominion—or,
rather, since they had allowed temporal interests to divert them
wholly from their spiritual duties—all had gone amiss. Christendom
was despoiled from without, and filled with tumult within. Religion
was openly contemned; Christ was daily bought and sold; the sheep
were shorn, and the pastor took no care of them. He did not even
hesitate to charge, with emphasis and at much detail, that the money
extorted from Germany under pious pretexts was squandered in
Italy on the private quarrels and for the aggrandizement of the
papal houses, and those of the members of the sacred college.<a id="FNanchor_1043_1043" href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">1043</a> All
other nations were protected from papal rapacity and tyranny by
formal agreements. Germany alone was surrendered defenceless,
and not only were her bishops plundered but even the smallest
benefice could not be confirmed without the recipient running the
gauntlet of a horde of officials whose exactions forced him to sell the
very furniture of his church. As the rules of law and the dictates of
justice were equally disregarded, the popular sentiment was becoming
openly hostile to the church.<a id="FNanchor_1044_1044" href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">1044</a> A state of feeling which dictated and
permitted such a declaration from the supreme representative body
of the empire, when brought into collision with the pretensions of
the Holy See, now more exaggerated than ever, could have but one
result—Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span></p>

<p>With all this license Germany was still, by the force of circumstances,
less independent of the papacy than any other Tramontane
power. What was going on elsewhere in Europe may be guessed from
the humiliating conditions exacted in 1517 of Silvester Darius, the
papal collector, on his assuming the functions of his important office
in England. He bound himself by oath not to execute any letters
or mandates of the pope injurious to the king, the kingdom, or the
laws; not to transmit from England to Rome, without a special royal
license, any gold, or silver, or bills of exchange; not to leave the
kingdom himself without a special license under the great seal; with
other less notable restrictions, the practical effect of all being to place
him and his duties wholly under the control of the king.<a id="FNanchor_1045_1045" href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">1045</a> The
position of England had changed since the days of Innocent and
John. Had the dissensions of Germany permitted equal progress,
Luther might perhaps have only been known as an obscure but
learned orthodox doctor, and the inevitable revolt of half of Christendom
have been postponed for a century.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is not my province to follow in detail the vicissitudes of the
Reformation, but only to indicate briefly its relations with sacerdotal
asceticism. Luther, at first, like Wickliffe and Huss, paid no attention
to the subject. In fact, when, on the 31st of October, 1217,
he nailed on the church door of Wittenberg his celebrated ninety-five
propositions, nothing was further from his expectations than to
create a heresy, a schism, or even a general reform in the church.
He had simply in view to vindicate his ideas on the subject of justification,
derived from St. Augustin, against the Thomist doctrines
which had been exaggerated into the monstrous abuses of Tetzel and
his fellows.<a id="FNanchor_1046_1046" href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">1046</a> In the general movement of the human mind at that
period so much had been said that was inimical to the received
practices of the church, without calling forth the thunders of Rome,
that men seemed to think the day of toleration had at last come.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
The hierarchy sat serenely upon their thrones and in the confidence
of unassailable power appeared willing to allow any freedom of
speculation which did not assail their temporal privileges. Yet amid
the general agitation and opposition to Rome which pervaded society,
it was impossible for a bold and self-reliant spirit such as Luther’s
not to advance step by step in a career of which the ultimate goal
was as little foreseen by himself as by others. Still his progress was
wonderfully slow. Even in 1519 he still considered himself within
the pale of the church, and held that no wrong committed by her
could justify a separation or excuse any resistance to the commands
of a pope;<a id="FNanchor_1047_1047" href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">1047</a> and in the same year, in a sermon on matrimony, he
alluded not unfavorably to the life of virginity.<a id="FNanchor_1048_1048" href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">1048</a> Events soon after
forced him to further and more dangerous innovations, yet when
Leo X., in June, 1520, issued his celebrated bull, “Exsurge Domine”
to crush the rising heresy, in the forty-one errors enumerated as
taught by Luther, there is no allusion to any doctrine specially
inimical to ascetic celibacy.<a id="FNanchor_1049_1049" href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">1049</a></p>

<p>This condemnation, followed as it was by the public burning of
his writings, aroused Luther to a more active and aggressive hostility
than he had previously manifested, In his book “De Captivitate
Babylonica Ecclesiæ” he attacked the sacrament of ordination,
denied that it separated the priest from his fellows, and ridiculed the
rule concerning digami, which excluded from the priesthood a
man who had been the husband of any but a virgin, while another
who had polluted himself with six hundred concubines was eligible to
the episcopate or papacy.<a id="FNanchor_1050_1050" href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">1050</a> Finally on Dec. 10th, 1520, he proclaimed
war to the knife by burning at Wittenberg the books of the
canon law and justifying this act by a manifesto recapitulating the
damnable doctrines contained in them. Among these he enumerates
the prohibition of sacerdotal marriage, as the origin and cause of
excessive vice and scandal.<a id="FNanchor_1051_1051" href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">1051</a> As he said himself, hitherto he had
only been playing at controversy with the Pope, but this was the
beginning of the tragedy.<a id="FNanchor_1052_1052" href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">1052</a> Soon after this, in a controversy with
Ambrogio Catarino, he stigmatized the rule of celibacy as angelical in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
appearance, but devilish in reality, and invented by Satan as a fertile
source of sin and perdition.<a id="FNanchor_1053_1053" href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">1053</a></p>

<p>In the mighty movement which was agitating men’s minds, Luther
had been anticipated in this. As early as 1518, a monk of Dantzic
named James Knade, abandoned his order, married, and publicly
preached resistance to Rome. It is evident that in this he had the
support of the people, for though he was imprisoned and tried by the
ecclesiastical authorities, the only punishment inflicted on him was
banishment.<a id="FNanchor_1054_1054" href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">1054</a> In the multitude of other questions more interesting
to the immediate disputants this point of discipline seems to have
attracted but little attention until 1521, when during Luther’s
enforced seclusion in Wartburg, Bartholomew Bernhardi, pastor of
Kammerich, near Wittenberg, put the heresiarch’s views into action
in the most practical way by obtaining the consent of his parish and
celebrating his nuptials with all due solemnity. Albert, Archbishop
of Mainz and Magdeburg, addressed to Frederic, Elector of Saxony,
a demand for the rendition of the culprit, which that prudent patron
of the Reformation skilfully eluded, and Bernhardi published a short
defence or apology in which he denounced the rule of celibacy as a
“frivolam traditiunculam.” He argued the matter, quoting the texts
which since his time have been generally employed in support of
sacerdotal marriage; he referred to Peter and Philip, Spiridon of
Cyprus, and Hilary of Poitiers, as examples of married bishops,
quoted the story of Paphnutius, and relied on the authority of the
Greek church. This apparently did not satisfy the archbishop, for
Bernhardi felt obliged to address a second apology to Frederic of
Saxony, to whom he appealed for protection against the displeasure
of his ecclesiastical superiors.<a id="FNanchor_1055_1055" href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">1055</a> In spite of molestation, he continued
in the exercise of his priestly functions until death. Less fortunate
were his immediate imitators. A priest of Mansfeld who took to
himself a wife was thrown into prison at Halle by the Archbishop of
Mainz, and Jacob Siedeler, pastor of Glashütten, in Misnia, who
was guilty of the same crime, perished miserably in the dungeon of
Stolpen, to which he was committed by Duke George of Saxony.<a id="FNanchor_1056_1056" href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">1056</a></p>

<p>The enthusiastic Carlostadt, relieved for the time from the restraint
of Luther’s cooler wisdom, threw himself with zeal into this new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
movement of reform, and lost no time in justifying it by a treatise in
which he argued strenuously in favor of priestly marriage, and energetically
denounced the monastic vows as idle and vain. Luther,
however, in his retreat, seems not yet prepared to take any very
decided position. In a letter of Jan. 17th, 1522, to Wolfgang
Fabricius Capito, one of the officials of the Archbishop of Mainz, he
takes the latter severely to task with respect to his action in a case
of the kind—probably that of the priest of Mansfeld alluded to
above. The man had been set at liberty, but forced to separate himself
from his wife, and Capito had defended himself on the ground
that the woman was a harlot. Luther asks him why he had been so
earnest with a single strumpet, when he had taken no action with so
many under his jurisdiction in Halberstadt, Mainz, and Magdeburg,
and adds that when the priest had acknowledged the woman as his
wife there should have been nothing further done. He proceeds to
say, however, that he does not ask for the freedom of sacerdotal
marriage, and that he is not prepared to take any general position
concerning it, except that it is lawful under God.<a id="FNanchor_1057_1057" href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">1057</a> Either with or
without his approbation, however, his friends lost no time in enforcing
the new dogma which they proclaimed to the world in the most
authoritative manner. During the same year Luther’s own Augustinian
order held a provincial synod at Wittenberg, in which they
formally threw open the doors of the monasteries, and permitted all
who desired it to return to the world, declaring that in Christ there
was no distinction between Jew and Greek, monk and layman, and
that a vow in opposition to the gospel was no vow, but an impiety.
Ceremonies, observances, and dress were pronounced futile; those
who chose to abide by the established rule were free to do so, but
their preferences were not to be a law to their fellows. Those who
were fitted for preaching the word were advised to depart; those who
remained were obliged to perform the manual labor which had been
so prominent a portion of primæval Teutonic monasticism, and
mendicancy was strictly forbidden. In a few short and simple
canons a radical rebellion thus declared itself in the heart of an
ancient and powerful order, and principles were promulgated which
were totally at variance with sacerdotalism in all its protean forms.<a id="FNanchor_1058_1058" href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">1058</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span></p>

<p>This broad spirit of toleration did not suit the views of the more
progressive reformers. In Luther’s own Augustinian convent at
Wittenberg, one of his most zealous adherents, Gabriel Zwilling,
preached against monachism in general, taking the ground that salvation
required the renunciation of their vows by all who had been
ensnared into assuming the cowl; and so great was his success that
thirteen monks at once abandoned the convent. Yet even on Luther’s
return to Wittenberg, he at first took no part in the movement.
He retained his Augustinian habit, and continued his residence in
the convent; but before the close of the year (1522) he put forth
his work, “De Votis Monasticis,” in which he fully and finally
adopted the views of his friends, and showed himself as an uncompromising
enemy of monasticism.<a id="FNanchor_1059_1059" href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">1059</a> How difficult it was for him,
however, to shake off the habitudes in which he had been trained is
shown by the fact that, even at the end of 1523, he still sometimes
preached in his cowl and sometimes without it.<a id="FNanchor_1060_1060" href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">1060</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the zealous opposition of the orthodox ecclesiastical
authorities, the doctrine and practice of Wittenberg were not
long in finding earnest defenders and imitators. But few such marriages,
it is true, are recorded in 1522, although Balthazar Sturmius,
an Augustinian monk of Saxony, committed the bolder indiscretion
of marrying a widow of Franconia. In that year, however, we find
Franz von Sickingen, knight-errant and condottiero, who was then
a power in the state, advocating the emancipation and marriage of
the religious orders, in a letter to his father-in-law, Diedrich von
Henthschuchsheym. Still more important was the movement inaugurated
in Switzerland by Ulrich Zwingli, who, with ten other
monks of Nôtre-Dame-des-Hermites, on the 2d of July, 1522,
addressed to Hugo von Hohenlandemberg, Bishop of Constance, a
petition requesting the privilege of marriage. The petitioners boldly
argued the matter, citing the usual Scriptural authorities, and adjured
the bishop in the most pressing terms to grant their request. They
warned him that a refusal might entail ruinous disorders on the whole
sacerdotal body, and that, unless he seized the opportunity to guide
the movement, it might speedily assume a most disastrous shape.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
They asserted, indeed, that not only in Switzerland, but elsewhere,
it was generally believed that a majority of ecclesiastics had already
chosen their future wives, and that a return to the old order of things
was beyond the power of man to accomplish.<a id="FNanchor_1061_1061" href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">1061</a></p>

<p>In this assertion, Zwingli and his companions followed perhaps
rather the dictates of their hopes than of their judgment, for the
revolution was by no means as universal or immediate as their threats
or warnings would indicate. Its progress, nevertheless, was rapid
and decided. Luther, whom we have seen, in the earlier part of
1522, still giving but a qualified assent to the daring innovation of
his followers, in February, 1523, wrote to Spalatin in favor of a
married pastor who was seeking preferment at the hands of the
Elector Frederic;<a id="FNanchor_1062_1062" href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">1062</a> and in April, 1523, he himself officiated and
preached a sermon in favor of matrimony to a multitude of distinguished
friends at the wedding of Wenceslas Link, vicar of the
Augustinian order, one of his oldest and most valued supporters,
who had stood unflinchingly by him when arraigned by Cardinal
Caietano before the Emperor Maximilian at the Diet of Augsburg.<a id="FNanchor_1063_1063" href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">1063</a>
Not less important was the countenance given to the innovation, two
days later, by the Elector Frederic, who consented to act as sponsor
at the baptism of the first-born of Franz Gunther, pastor of Loch;<a id="FNanchor_1064_1064" href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">1064</a>
the ceremony being performed by the honest chronicler Spalatin
himself.</p>

<p>It is curious to see in Spalatin’s diary how each successive marriage
is recorded as a matter of the utmost interest, the hopes of the
reformers being strengthened by every accession to the ranks of those
who dared to defy the rules which had been deemed irreversible for
centuries. Nor was it an act without danger, for no open rupture
had as yet taken place between the temporal power of any state and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
the central authority at Rome. Even in Electoral Saxony, though
Duke Frederic, by a cautious course of passive resistance, afforded
protection to the heretics, yet he still considered himself a Catholic,
and the ritual of his chapel was unaltered. Elsewhere the ecclesiastical
power was bent on asserting its supremacy over the licentious
apostates who ventured to sully their vows and prostitute the sacrament
of marriage by their incestuous unions. The old charge of
promiscuous intercourse was resorted to in their case, as it has been
with almost every heresy in every age, for the purpose of exciting
popular odium,<a id="FNanchor_1065_1065" href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">1065</a> and wherever the discipline of the church could be
enforced, it was done unsparingly. The temper of these endeavors
to repress the movement is well illustrated by the regulations promulgated
under the authority of the Cardinal-legate Campeggi,
when, in 1524, he succeeded in uniting a number of reactionary
princes at the Assembly of Ratisbon. Deploring the sacrilege committed
in the marriages of priests and monks, which were becoming
extremely common, he granted permission to the secular powers to
seize all such apostates and deliver them to the ecclesiastical officials,
significantly restraining them, however, from inflicting torture. The
officials were empowered to condemn the offenders to perpetual imprisonment,
or to hand them over to the secular arm—a decent
euphuism for a frightful death; and any negligence on the part of
the ordinaries exposed those officers to the pains and penalties of
heresy.<a id="FNanchor_1066_1066" href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">1066</a></p>

<p>In spite of all this, however, the votaries of marriage had the
support and sympathy of the great body of the people. It shows
how widely diffused and strongly implanted was the conviction of
the evils of celibacy, when those who four centuries earlier had so
cruelly persecuted their pastors for not discarding their wives now
urged them to marriage, and were ready to protect them from the
consequences of the act. Thus, during the summer of 1524, Wolfgang
Fabricius Capito, provost of St. Thomas and priest of the
church of St. Peter at Strassburg, whom we have seen two years
earlier prosecuting a married priest, took to himself a wife, by the
request of his parishioners, and when the chapter of canons endeavored
to interfere with him, the threatening aspect of the populace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
warned them to desist. Nor was this the only case, for Bishop William
undertook to excommunicate all the married priests of Strassburg,
when the senate of the city resolutely espoused their cause,
and even the authority of the legate Campeggi could not reconcile
the quarrel.<a id="FNanchor_1067_1067" href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">1067</a></p>

<p>Even higher protection was sometimes not wanting. When Adrian
II., in 1522, reproached the Diet of Nürnberg with the inobservance
of the decree of Worms and the consequent growth of Lutheranism,
and King Ferdinand, in the name of the German states, replied that
a council for the reformation of the church was the only remedy, the
question of married priests arose for discussion. The German princes
alleged that they could find in the civil and municipal laws no provisions
for the punishment of such transgressions, and that the canons
of discipline could only be enforced by the ecclesiastical authorities
themselves, who ought not to be interfered with in the discharge of
their duty by the secular authorities.<a id="FNanchor_1068_1068" href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">1068</a> This was scant encouragement,
but even this was often denied in practice. When, in 1523,
Conrad von Tungen, Bishop of Wurzburg, threw into prison two of
his canons, the doctors John Apel and Frederic Fischer, for the crime
of marrying nuns, the Council of Regency at Nürnberg forced him
to liberate them in a few weeks.<a id="FNanchor_1069_1069" href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">1069</a> This latter fact is the more remarkable,
since, but a short time previous (March 6th, 1523), the
Imperial Diet at Nürnberg, under the auspices of the same Regency,
had expressed its desire to give every assistance to the ecclesiastical
authority in enforcing the canons. In a decree on the subject of the
religious disturbances, it adopted the canon law on celibacy as part
of the civil law, pronouncing sentence of imprisonment and confiscation
on all members of the clergy who should marry, and ordering
the civil power in all cases to assist the ecclesiastical in its efforts to
punish offenders.<a id="FNanchor_1070_1070" href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">1070</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span></p>

<p>The emancipation of nuns excited considerable public interest, and
in many instances was effected by aid from without. A certain Leonhard
Kopp, who was a determined enemy of monachism, rendered
himself somewhat notorious by exploits of the kind. One of the
earliest instances was that by which, on Easter eve, 1523, at considerable
risk, he succeeded in carrying off from the convent of
Nimptschen, in Misnia, eight young virgins of noble birth, all of
whom were subsequently married, and one of whom was Catharine
von Bora.<a id="FNanchor_1071_1071" href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">1071</a> The example was contagious. Before the month was
out six nuns, all of noble blood, left the abbey of Sormitz, and soon
after eight escaped from that of Peutwitz, at Weissenfels.<a id="FNanchor_1072_1072" href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">1072</a> Monks
enfranchised themselves with still less trouble. At Nürnberg, in
1524, the Augustinians in a body threw off their cowls and proclaimed
themselves citizens.<a id="FNanchor_1073_1073" href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">1073</a></p>

<p>Finally, Luther gave the last and most unquestionable proof of his
adhesion to the practice of sacerdotal marriage by espousing Catharine
von Bora, whom we have seen escaping, two years before, from
the convent of Nimptschen. Scandal, it would seem, had been busy
with the intimacy between the pious doctor and the fair renegade,
who had spent nearly the whole period of her liberty at Wittenberg,
and Luther, with the practical decision of character which distinguished
him, suddenly resolved to put the most effectual stop to
rumors which his enemies doubtless were delighted to circulate.
On the evening of June 13th, 1525, without consulting his friends,
he invited to supper Pomeranius, Lucas Cranach, and Apellus, and
had the marriage ceremony performed.<a id="FNanchor_1074_1074" href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">1074</a> It took his followers completely
by surprise; many of them disapproved of it, and Justus
Jonas, in communicating the fact to Spalatin, characterizes it as a
startling event, and evidently feels that his correspondent will require
the most incontrovertible evidence of the fact, when he declares that
he himself had been present and had seen the bridegroom in the
marriage bed.<a id="FNanchor_1075_1075" href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">1075</a> If the portraits after Lucas Cranach given in Maye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>r’s
Dissertation on Catharine be faithful likenesses, it was scarcely the
beauty of his bride that led Luther to take this step, for her features
seem rather African than European.<a id="FNanchor_1076_1076" href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">1076</a></p>

<p>When Luther had once decided for himself on the propriety of
sacerdotal marriage, he was not likely to stop half-way. Some of
the reformers were disposed to adopt the principles of the early
church, and, while permitting married priests to officiate, denied to
them the right to marry a second time or to espouse any but virgins,
declaring all <i>digami</i> worthy of death and calling upon the people to
drive them out. Against these Luther, in 1528, took up the cudgels
vigorously, arguing the question in all its bearings and arriving at
the conclusion that only bigamists were to be shunned or deemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
unworthy of holy orders.<a id="FNanchor_1077_1077" href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">1077</a> Yet at the same time his thoroughly
practical mind prevented him from losing sight of some of the evils
inseparable from the revolution which he had wrought in an institution
so deeply affecting daily life as monasticism. As late as 1543,
in a letter to Spalatin, while congratulating him on the desire expressed
by some nuns to leave their convent, he cautions them not
to do so unless they have a certainty or, at least, a speedy prospect
of marriage. He complains of the number of such cases in which
he had been obliged to support the fugitives, and he concludes by
declaring that old women who had no chance of finding husbands
had much better remain in their cloisters.<a id="FNanchor_1078_1078" href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">1078</a></p>

<p>It is not difficult to explain why there was so ready and general
an acquiescence in the abrogation of a rule established by the veneration
of so many centuries. Not only had the doctrines of the
reformers taken a deep and firm hold of the popular heart throughout
Germany, destroying the reverence for tradition and antiquity,
and releasing the human mind from the crushing obligation of blind
obedience, but there were other motives, natural, if not particularly
creditable. The ecclesiastical foundations had long neglected the
duties of charity, hospitality, and education, on which were grounded
their claims to their broad lands and rich revenues. While, therefore,
the temporal princes might be delighted with the opportunity
of secularizing and seizing the church possessions, the people might
reasonably hope that the increase of their rulers’ wealth would alleviate
their own burdens, as well as release them from the direct
oppression which many of them suffered from the religious establishments.
Even more potential was the disgust everywhere felt for the
flagrant immorality of the priesthood. The dread experienced by
every husband and father lest wife and daughter might at any moment
fall victims to the lust of those who had every opportunity for
the gratification of unholy passions, led them to welcome the change,
in the hope that it would result in restoring decency and virtue to a
class which had long seemed to regard its sacred character as the
shield and instrument of crime.</p>

<p>The moral character of the clergy, indeed, had not improved
during the busy and eventful years which marked the first quarter
of the sixteenth century. There is a curious little tract, printed in
Cologne in 1505, with the approbation of the faculty, which is di<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>rected
against concubinage in general, but particularly against that
of the priests. Its laborious accumulation of authorities to prove
that licentiousness is a sin is abundant evidence of the existing
demoralization, while the practices which it combats, of guilty ecclesiastics
granting absolution to each other and mutually dispensing
themselves from confession, show how easily the safeguards with
which the church had sought to surround her ministers were eluded.<a id="FNanchor_1079_1079" href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">1079</a>
The degradation of the priesthood, indeed, can readily be measured
when, in the little town of Hof, in the Vogtland, three priests could
be found defiling the sacredness of Ash-Wednesday by fiercely fighting
over a courtesan in a house of ill-fame;<a id="FNanchor_1080_1080" href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">1080</a> or when Leo X., in a
feeble effort at reform, was obliged to argue that systematic licentiousness
was not rendered excusable because its prevalence amounted
to a custom, or because it was openly tolerated by those whose duty
was to repress it.<a id="FNanchor_1081_1081" href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">1081</a> In fact, a clause in the Concordat with Francis I.
in 1516, renewing and enhancing the former punishments for public
concubinage, would almost justify the presumption that the principal
result of the rule of celibacy was to afford to the officials a regular
revenue derived from the sale of licenses to sin<a id="FNanchor_1082_1082" href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">1082</a>—the old abuse,
which rises before us in every age from the time of Damiani and
Hildebrand, and which, since John XXII. had framed the tariff of
absolutions for crime known as the “Taxes of the Penitentiary,”
had the authority of the papacy itself to justify it. In this curious
document we find that a concubinary priest could procure absolution
for less than a ducat “in spite of all provincial and synodal constitutions;”
while half a ducat was sufficient to absolve for incest committed
with a mother or a sister.<a id="FNanchor_1083_1083" href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">1083</a></p>

<p>That no concealment was thought necessary, and that sensual
indulgence was not deemed derogatory in any way to the character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
of a Christian prelate, may be reasonably deduced from the panegyric
of Gerard of Nimeguen on Philip of Burgundy, granduncle
of Charles V., a learned and accomplished man, who filled the important
see of Utrecht from 1517 to 1524. Gerard alludes to the
amorous propensities and promiscuous intrigues of his patron without
reserve, and as his book was dedicated to the Archduchess Margaret,
sister of Charles V., it is evident that he did not feel his
remarks to be defamatory. The good prelate, too, no doubt represented
the convictions of a large portion of his class, when he was
wont to smile at those who urged the propriety of celibacy, and to
declare his belief in the impossibility of chastity among men who,
like the clergy, were pampered with high living and tempted by
indolence. Those who professed to keep their vows inviolate he
denounced as hypocrites of the worst description, and he deemed
them far worse than their brethren who sought to avoid unnecessary
scandal by decently keeping their concubines at home.<a id="FNanchor_1084_1084" href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">1084</a></p>

<p>Even this reticence, however, was considered unnecessary by a
large portion of the clergy. In 1512, the Bishop of Ratisbon issued
a series of canons in which, after quoting the Basilian regulations,
he adds that many of his ecclesiastics maintain their concubines so
openly that it would appear as though they saw neither sin nor
scandal in such conduct, and that their evil example was the efficient
cause of corrupting the faithful.<a id="FNanchor_1085_1085" href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">1085</a> In Switzerland the same abuses
were quite as prevalent, if we may believe a memorial presented, in
1533, by the citizens of Lausanne, complaining of the conduct of
their clergy. They rebuked the incontinence of the priests, whose
numerous children were accustomed to earn a living by beggary in
the streets, but the canons were the subjects of their especial objurgation.
The dean of the chapter had defied an excommunication
launched at him for buying a house near the church in which to
keep his mistress; others of the canons had taken to themselves the
wives of citizens and refused to give them up; but the quaintest
grievance of which they had been guilty was the injury which their
competition inflicted on the public brothel of the town.<a id="FNanchor_1086_1086" href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">1086</a> What was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
the condition of clerical morality in Italy may be gathered from the
stories of Bishop Bandello, who, as a Dominican and a prelate, may
fairly be deemed to represent the tone of the thinking and educated
classes of society. The cynical levity with which he narrates
scandalous tales about monks and priests shows that in the public
mind sacerdotal immorality was regarded almost as a matter of
course.<a id="FNanchor_1087_1087" href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">1087</a></p>

<p>The powerful influence of all this on the progress of the Reformation
was freely admitted by the authorities of the church. When
the legate Campeggi was sent to Germany to check the spread of
heresy, in his reformatory edict issued at Ratisbon in 1524, he declared
that the efforts of the Lutherans had no little justification in
the detestable morals and lives of the clergy, and this is confirmed
by his unsparing denunciation of their licentiousness, drunkenness,
quarrels, and tavern-haunting; their traffic in absolution for enormous
offences; their unclerical habits and hideous blasphemy; their
indulgence in incantations and dabbling in witchcraft.<a id="FNanchor_1088_1088" href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">1088</a> Very significant
is his declaration that the canonical punishments shall be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
inflicted on concubinary priests, in spite of all custom to the contrary
or all connivance with the prelates.<a id="FNanchor_1089_1089" href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">1089</a></p>

<p>How little, indeed, licentious ecclesiastics might reasonably dread
the canonical punishments is illustrated in the report, by the celebrated
jurisconsult Grillandus, of a case which came before him while
he was auditor of the Papal Vicar in Rome. A Spanish priest and
Doctor of Canon Law, residing in the Christian capital, became
enamoured of several young nuns at once, and endeavored to seduce
them by teaching them that, as they and he were alike spouses of
Christ, carnal affection between them was their duty. Failing in
this, he sought to compel the assistance of God in his designs, and,
being a man of literary culture, he composed a number of prayers
of singular obscenity, and bribed various ignorant priests to recite
them amid the ineffable mysteries of the Mass, hoping thus to obtain
the aid of heaven in overcoming the chastity of his intended victims.
At length he chanced to offer one of these prayers to a priest of
somewhat better character, who was sufficiently shocked by it to
communicate with the authorities. Brought before Grillandus, the
guilty Spaniard sought to justify himself by alleging various Scriptural
texts, but, upon being warned that such a defence would subject
him to a prosecution for heresy, he recanted and acknowledged his
errors. For this complicated mingling of lust and sacrilege, his
only punishment was a short banishment from Rome.<a id="FNanchor_1090_1090" href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">1090</a> When the
papal court set such an example, what was to be expected of less
enlightened regions?</p>

<p>How keenly these evils were felt by the people, and how instinctively
they were referred to the rule of celibacy as to their proper
origin, is shown by an incidental allusion in the formula of complaint
laid before the pope by the imperial Diet held at Nürnberg early in
1522, before the heresy of priestly marriage had spread beyond the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
vicinity of Wittenberg. The Diet, in recounting the evils arising
from the ecclesiastical jurisdiction which allowed clerical offenders to
enjoy virtual immunity, adduced, among other grievances, the license
afforded to those who, debarred by the canons from marriage, abandoned
themselves night and day to attempts upon the virtue of the
wives and daughters of the laity, sometimes gaining their ends by
flattery and presents, and sometimes taking advantage of the opportunities
offered by the confessional. It was not uncommon, indeed,
for women to be openly carried off by their priests, while their husbands
and fathers were threatened with vengeance if they should
attempt to recover them. As regards the sale to ecclesiastics of
licenses to indulge in habitual lust, the Diet declared it to be a regular
and settled matter, reduced to the form of an annual tax, which
in most dioceses was exacted of all the clergy without exception, so
that when those who perchance lived chastely demurred at the payment,
they were told that the bishop must have the money, and that
after it was handed over they might take their choice whether to
keep concubines or not.<a id="FNanchor_1091_1091" href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">1091</a> In the face of this condition of ecclesiastical
morality, it required some obtuseness for Adrian VI. to compare
Luther to Mahomet, the one seeking to attract to his party the
carnal-minded by permitting marriage, even as the other had established
polygamy,<a id="FNanchor_1092_1092" href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">1092</a> and, further, to abuse him for uniting the ministers
of Christ with the vilest harlots.<a id="FNanchor_1093_1093" href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">1093</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among the diverse opinions of existing evils and their remedy, it
is interesting to see what was the view of the subject taken by those
ecclesiastics whose purity of life removed them from all temptation
to indulgence, and who yet were not personally interested in upholding
the gigantic but decaying structure of sacerdotalism. Of these
men Erasmus may be taken as the representative. His opinion on
all the questions of the day was too eagerly desired for him to escape
the necessity of pronouncing his verdict on the innovation portended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
by the one or two marriages which took place near Wittenberg in
1521, and accordingly, in 1522, from his retreat at Bâle he issued a
short dissertation on the subject, which, although addressed merely
to Bishop Christopher of that city, was evidently intended for a
European audience. In this essay, after sketching the rise of celibacy
and attributing it to the purity and fervor of the early Christians,
he proceeds to depict the altered condition of the church.
Among the innumerable multitude of priests who crowd the monasteries,
the chapters, and the parishes, he declares that there are few
indeed whose lives are pure, even as respects open and avowed concubinage,
without penetrating into the mysteries of secret intrigue.
As, therefore, there is no Scriptural injunction of celibacy, he concludes
that, however desirable it might be to have ministers free
from the cares of marriage and devoting themselves solely to the
service of God, yet, since it seems impossible to conquer the rebellious
flesh, it would be better to allow those who cannot control
themselves to have wives with whom they could live in virtuous
peace, bringing up their children in the fear of God, and earning
the respect of their flocks. No more startling evidence, indeed, of
the demoralization of the period could be given than the cautious
fear which Erasmus expresses lest such a change should be opposed
by the episcopal officials, who would object to the diminution of their
unhallowed gains levied on the concubines of the clergy.<a id="FNanchor_1094_1094" href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">1094</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When such was the condition of ecclesiastical morality, and such
were the opinions of all except those directly interested in upholding
the old order of things, it is no wonder if the people were disposed
to look with favor on the marriage of their pastors, and if the rejec<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>tion
of celibacy gave a fresh impetus to the cause of Lutheranism.
In the early days of all sects, it is only those of ardent faith and
pure zeal who are likely to embrace a new belief, with all the
attendant risks of persecution and contumely. The laxity of life
allowed to the Catholic clergy would attract to its ranks and retain
those whose aim was sensual indulgence. Thus, necessarily, the
reformers who married would present for contrast regular and chaste
lives and well-ordered households, purified by the dread of the ever-impending
troubles to which the accident of a day might at any time
expose them. The comparison thus was in every way favorable to
the new ideas, and they flourished accordingly.</p>

<p>Nor, perhaps, were the worldly inducements to which I have before
alluded less powerful in their own way in advancing the cause.
Shortly before Luther’s marriage, whatever influence was derivable
from an aristocratic example was obtained when the Baron of Heydeck,
a knight of the Teutonic order, renounced his vows and publicly
espoused a nun of Ligny.<a id="FNanchor_1095_1095" href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">1095</a> This may possibly have encouraged
his superior, Albert of Brandenburg, grand-master of the order, to
execute his remarkably successful coup d’état in changing his religion
and seizing the estates of the order, thus practically founding the
state which chance and talent have exalted until it has been able to
realize, at least for a time, the day-dream of a united Germany.
The liberty of marriage which he thus assumed was soon turned to
account in his advantageous alliance with Frederic, King of Denmark,
whose daughter Dorothea he espoused, the Bishop of Szamland
officiating as his proxy, and the actual marriage being celebrated
June 14, 1526.<a id="FNanchor_1096_1096" href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">1096</a></p>

<p>Luther may reasonably be held excusable for counselling and aiding
a transaction which lent such incalculable strength to the struggling
cause of the Reformation, and it is not to be wondered at if he endeavored
to follow it up with another of a similar character. The
nephew of the Duke of Prussia, also named Albert of Brandenburg,
occupied the highest place in the Teutonic hierarchy, as Archbishop
both of Mainz and Magdeburg, in the latter of which powerful sees
the Lutheran heresies had taken deep root. Luther sought to induce
the archbishop to follow his uncle’s example; to take possession in
his own right of the Magdeburg territories, and to transmit them to
the posterity with which heaven could not fail to bless his prospective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
marriage—a scheme which met the warm approbation of the leading
nobles of the diocese. Albert thought seriously of the project, especially
as the Peasants’ War then raging was directed particularly
against the lands of the church, but he finally abandoned it, and his
flock had to work out their reformation without his assistance.<a id="FNanchor_1097_1097" href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">1097</a></p>

<p>Perhaps some plans of territorial aggrandizement may have stimulated
the zeal of the Count of Embden, who boasted that he had
assisted and encouraged the marriage of no less than five hundred
monks and nuns;<a id="FNanchor_1098_1098" href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">1098</a> yet the process of secularizing the monastic foundations
was in many places by no means sudden or violent. Thus,
when the Abbot of Ilgenthal in Saxony died, in 1526, the Elector
John simply forbade the election of a successor, and placed the
abbey in charge of a prefect, while the remaining monks were liberally
supplied until they one after another died out,<a id="FNanchor_1099_1099" href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">1099</a> and in 1529,
when Philip, Count of Waldeck, took possession of the ancient
monastery of Hainscheidt, he caused all the monks to be supported
during life.<a id="FNanchor_1100_1100" href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">1100</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Through all this period the hope had never been abandoned of
such an arrangement as would prevent an irrevocable separation in
the church. Moderate and temperate men on both sides were ready
to make such concessions of form as would enable Christendom to
remain united, as the great vital truths on which all were agreed so
far outweighed the points of divergence. Whether these hopes were
well or ill-founded was to be determined at the Diet of Augsburg,
to which, in June, 1530, both parties were summoned for the purpose
of submitting their differences to the emperor. Charles came
to Germany in the full flush of his recent extraordinary triumphs,
the most powerful prince since the days of Charlemagne. Europe
was at length at peace, even the Turk only looming in the East as a
probable, not as an existing, enemy. But Charles, newly crowned
at Bologna, came ostensibly as the steadfast ally of the pope, and
Clement VII. had not the slightest intention of renouncing the traditional
and imprescriptible rights of the Holy See. The Catholic
princes of Germany, too, had their grounds of private quarrel with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
their Protestant peers, and, holding an unquestioned majority, were
not disposed to abandon their position. The Protestant princes, on
the other hand, were firm in their new-found faith, and, however
disposed to avert the threatened storm by the sacrifice of non-essentials,
their convictions were too strong for them to retrace the steps
which they had taken during so many long and weary years. It is
evident that, with such materials on either side, no reunion was probable;
and, even had an accommodation on points of doctrine been
possible, there was one subject which scarcely seemed to admit of
satisfactory compromise. In the states of the reform, the downfall of
monachism had placed in the hands of the temporal powers large
bodies of sequestrated abbey lands. To the Catholic it was sacrilege
to leave these in the hands of the spoiler; the Protestant would
not willingly give up the spoil.</p>

<p>The contest was opened by the Protestants submitting a statement
of their belief, divided into two parts, the one devoted to points of
faith, the other to matters of practice. Prepared principally by
Melanchthon, it presents their tenets in the mildest and least objectionable
form, and becoming the recognized standard of their creed,
it has attained a world-wide renown under the name of the Confession
of Augsburg. The questions of celibacy and monastic vows
were ably and temperately argued; their post-scriptural origin was
shown, and the reasons which induced the reformers to reject them
were placed in a light as little offensive as possible.<a id="FNanchor_1101_1101" href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">1101</a> At first, a
counter-statement was anticipated from the Catholics, and negotiations
were expected to be carried on by a comparison of the two, but
they took higher ground, and contented themselves with drawing up
a refutation of the Confession. The emperor was firm. His aspirations
for the universal monarchy, which ever eluded his grasp, did
not comport with encouraging independence of thought and freedom
of religious belief. In his theory, uniform subordination of religion
was a necessary element of the political system which was to make
him sovereign of Europe, and he would listen to no compromise.
He was inclined to summary measures, but the Catholic princes were
hardly prepared for the consequences of an immediate rupture, and,
after a threatening interval, another effort was made to effect a
reconciliation. Conferences between the leading theologians on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
both sides took place, and the Lutherans, warned of their danger,
were more disposed than ever to make concessions and to accept
such terms as the stronger party were willing to offer them. At
length, on the 8th of September, the draft of a proposed plan of
accord was laid before the Diet. In this the points in dispute were
referred to that future œcumenic council which had so long been
demanded as the panacea for all ecclesiastical ills, and which, after
more than thirty years of continued expectation, was destined to fail
so miserably in reconciling difficulties. Such monasteries as had
not been destroyed were to be maintained in the exercise of the customary
rites and observances of religion. Abbots and communities
who had been ejected were to be allowed to return; and all religious
houses which had been emptied of their occupants were to be placed
in the hands of officers appointed by the emperor, who were to administer
to their possessions until the future council should decide
upon all the points relating to monachism; the Protestants thus
relieving themselves of the accusation that they were actuated by
motives of worldly gain. Similar proposals were made with regard
to communion in the two elements and clerical marriage. These
were left as open questions for the council to settle, while a phrase
of doubtful import subjected them in the mean time to the governments
of the several states.<a id="FNanchor_1102_1102" href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">1102</a> The concessions in this project, however,
though they might suit the views of temperate doctors and
princes in Germany, and though even the Roman curia might be
willing to grant them in order to save its threatened temporal power
over the Teutonic states, did not suit the policy of Charles, who
regarded the church as simply one of the instruments with which he
was to build up his universal empire.<a id="FNanchor_1103_1103" href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">1103</a> It was not difficult for him,
therefore, to bring to naught all such schemes of conciliation. The
restoration of all abbots and monks was ordered; restitution of
church lands was commanded, or their delivery to the emperor to
be held until the assembling of the future council; and when the
Diet adjourned, Charles issued a decree enjoining on all married
priests to abstain from their wives, to eject them, and to seek absolution
from their ordinaries.<a id="FNanchor_1104_1104" href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">1104</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span></p>

<p>The threatening aspect of affairs warned the Protestant princes
that no time was to be lost in making provision for mutual defence,
and ere the year was out the famous League of Schmalkalden enabled
them to present a united front to the powers which they had virtually
defied. Into the political history of that eventful time it is not my
province to enter. Suffice it to say that they were able to maintain
their position, and in their own states to oppose the reactionary
movement which at times seemed to be on the point of destroying
all that had been accomplished.</p>

<p>In this their task was complicated by the extravagances of those
whose enthusiasm, unbalanced by reason, carried them beyond
restraint. If Luther had found it no easy task to break the chains
which for so many ages had kept in check the spirit of free inquiry,
he discovered that it was impossible to control that spirit once let
loose; and the wild excesses of Anabaptism were at once the exaggeration
and the opprobrium of Lutheranism. Originally earnest
and self-denying, the primitive Anabaptists had captivated the fiery
soul of Carlostadt, while Luther was in his Patmos of Wartburg,
but the pure asceticism of Storck and Muncer gradually grew irksome
to the followers who flocked to their standard, and, if we may
believe contemporary writers, the unchaining of human passions in
that lawless horde resulted in the <i>igneum baptisma</i>, or fiery baptism,
by which at Munster John Mathison encouraged the most hideous
licentiousness in the elect, to be followed up by his successor, John
of Leyden, who, in imitation of the patriarchs, promulgated the law
of polygamy.<a id="FNanchor_1105_1105" href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">1105</a></p>

<p>Luther, however, was quite as resolute in setting limits to his
movement as Rome had been in forbidding all progress, and the
Anabaptists were to him enemies as detestable as Catholics. The
Protestant princes, moreover, had too much worldly wisdom to imperil
their dangerous career by any alliance with fanatics whose
extravagances provoked abhorrence so general. The cause of the
Reformation, therefore, although it suffered no little from so portentous
an illustration of the dangers resulting from the destruction
of the ancient barriers, escaped all contamination in itself, and its
leaders pursued their course undeviatingly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile the League of Schmalkalden accomplished its purpose.
Henry VIII. and Francis I. were eager to seize the opportunity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
encouraging dissension in the empire. The Turk became more
menacing than ever. Charles, always ready to yield for a time
when opposition was impolitic, gracefully abandoned the position
assumed at Augsburg; and the negotiations of Schweinfurth and
Nürnberg resulted in the decree of the Diet of Ratisbon in 1532,
by which, until the assembling of the future council, all religious
disturbances were prohibited, and the imperial chamber was commanded
to undertake no prosecutions on account of heresy. Toleration
was thus practically established for the moment, but the
abbots and monks who had been ejected, and who had been anticipating
their restoration, became naturally restive. Charles cunningly
sent from Italy full powers to the chamber to decide as to
what causes arose from religious disputes, and what were simply
civil or criminal. Thus intrusted with the interpretation of the
Ratisbon decree, the chamber assumed that claims on church lands
were not included in the forbidden class, while old edicts prohibiting
the observances of Lutheranism brought all religious questions within
the scope of criminal law. The promised toleration was thus practically
denied, but, fortunately for the Protestants, Ferdinand was
anxiously negotiating for their recognition of his dignity as king of
the Romans, and by the Transaction of Cadam in 1533 he purchased
the coveted homage by accepting their construction of the edict of
Ratisbon.</p>

<p>Still the Protestants complained of persecution and the Catholics
of proselytism. The ensuing fifteen years were filled with a series
of bootless negotiations, pretended settlements, quarrels, recriminations,
and mutual encroachments which year after year occupied the
successive Diets, and kept Germany constantly trembling on the
verge of a desolating civil war. It would be useless to disturb the
dust that covers these forgotten transactions, which can teach us
nothing save that the Protestants still refused to recognize that the
schism was past human power to heal; that Rome, recovering from
her temporary hesitation, would not abate one jot of her pretensions
to save her supremacy over half of Christendom;<a id="FNanchor_1106_1106" href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">1106</a> and that Charles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
as a wily politician, was always ready in adversity to abandon with
a good grace that which he had arrogantly seized in prosperity.<a id="FNanchor_1107_1107" href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">1107</a>
How eager, indeed, were the Protestants to effect some compromise
which should relieve them from their exceptional position is strikingly
manifest in the Articles which Melanchthon and his friends,
in 1535, submitted to Francis I., after the Sorbonne had refused to
enter into a disputation or conference with them. In this document
all non-essentials were abandoned; doctrinal dissidences were skilfully
evaded, and stress only was laid upon such regulations as should
remove the external corruption of the church. Melanchthon proposed
that the monastic orders should be continued, but that the
vows should not be perpetual, so that religion might not be disgraced
by the excesses of those who had mistaken their vocation. So, as
regards priestly celibacy, he proposed that, as human nature rendered
it impossible to supply the multitude of parishes with men
able to live in continence, those who could not preserve their purity
should be allowed to marry; while, to prevent the dilapidation of
church property, the higher positions should be reserved to men of
mature age, who could lead a single life.<a id="FNanchor_1108_1108" href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">1108</a> The Sorbonne, in reply,
condescended to no argument, but contented itself with asserting
that the Protestants desired the subversion of all religion, while, on
the other hand, Melanchthon had the satisfaction of being proclaimed
a traitor by the Germans.</p>

<p>In all this the only point which possesses special interest for us is
another authoritative attempt at reconciling the irreconcilable which
occurred in 1541. After a conference between Melanchthon and
Dr. Eck at Worms, Charles himself presented to the Diet of Ratisbon
a statement of the questions in dispute, with propositions for mutual
concession and compromise. In the course of this, he reviewed
the practice of the church in various ages with regard to sacerdotal
celibacy, admitting that the enforcement of it was not in accordance
with the ancient canons, and indicating a willingness to see it abrogated.<a id="FNanchor_1109_1109" href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">1109</a>
The Protestants, who were ready to make many sacrifices
for peace, hailed this intimation with triumph, stoutly insisting on
the repeal of the obnoxious rule, which they stigmatized as unjust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
and pernicious.<a id="FNanchor_1110_1110" href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">1110</a> So nearly did the parties at length approach each
other, that there appeared every reason to anticipate a successful
result to the effort, when Paul III. again interfered and pronounced
all the proceedings null and void, as the church alone had power to
regulate its internal affairs. The expectations excited by these negotiations
naturally stimulated the desire of the people for a change
in the discipline of the church, and the next year we find Paul III.
obliged to exhort the Bishop of Merseburg to resist the clamors of
his subjects, who demanded the abrogation of priestly celibacy and
the use of the cup for the laity, under threats of ejecting him. The
pope evidently considered the Germans unduly impatient, since they
objected to await the assembling of the Council of Trent, which was
called to decide upon these matters.<a id="FNanchor_1111_1111" href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">1111</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Charles had long recognized that the perpetual menace of a powerful
confederation such as the Schmalkaldic League, entertaining
constant relations with the external enemies of the empire, was incompatible
with the peace of Germany and with an imperial power
such as he was resolved to wield. The time at last came for the
development of his plans. The skill of Alva and the treachery of
Maurice of Saxony were crowned with success. The battle of Muhlberg
broke the power of the Protestants utterly, and laid them helpless
at the feet of their bitterest foes. Yet the progress of the new
ideas had already placed them beyond the control of even the triumphant
Charles, though he had the Elector of Saxony and the
Landgrave of Hesse in his dungeons. When, at the Diet of Augsburg,
in 1548, he proposed the curious arrangement known as the
<i>Interim</i>, by which he hoped to keep matters quiet until the final
verdict of that œcumenic council which constantly vanished in the
distance, he felt it necessary to permit all married priests to retain
their wives until the question should be decided by the future council.
A faint expression of a preference for celibacy, moreover, was significant
both in what it said and what it left unsaid.<a id="FNanchor_1112_1112" href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">1112</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span></p>

<p>The Interim, of course, satisfied neither party. The Catholics
regarded it as an unauthorized reformation, the Protestants as disguised
popery. Charles, however, in the plenitude of his power,
obliged many of the Lutheran states to accept it; while, as regards
the Catholics, he was perhaps not sorry to show the pope that he,
too, like Henry VIII., could regulate the consciences of his subjects,
and prescribe their religious faith. He had broken with Paul III.;
the council of Trent, against his wishes, had been removed to Bologna
on a frivolous pretext; and a schism like that of England was
apparently impending. At the least, Charles might not unreasonably
desire to manifest that at last he was independent of that papal
power with which mutual necessities had so long enforced the closest
relations, and to prove that deference to his wishes was henceforth to
be the price of his all-important support. He demanded that legates
should be sent to Germany armed with extraordinary powers, among
which was included authority to grant dispensations to married priests.
Paul III. referred the request to the Sacred College and to the council
then sitting at Bologna, and it was unanimously replied that it should
be granted, with the limitations that monks should not be included,
and that priests thus permitted to retain their wives should not exercise
their functions or enjoy the fruits of their benefices.<a id="FNanchor_1113_1113" href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">1113</a> That Paul
forthwith dispatched three nuncios entrusted with authority to do this
shows not only the disposition which then existed to relax the rigor
of the canons respecting celibacy, but also the importance which the
question had assumed in the religious disputes of the time,<a id="FNanchor_1114_1114" href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">1114</a> though
an absolute refusal was soon afterwards returned to the request of a
German prince (supposed to be the Duke of Bavaria) requesting for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
his subjects the use of the cup, priestly marriage, and the relaxation
of the obligation of fasting.<a id="FNanchor_1115_1115" href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">1115</a></p>

<p>Temporary expedients and compromises such as these are interesting
merely as they mark the progress of opinion. Paltry makeshifts
to elude the decision of that which had to be decided, they
exercised little real influence on the history of the time. It is true
that when Charles, in 1551, at the Diet of Augsburg, issued a call
for the reassembling of the council of Trent, he confirmed the Interim
until that council should decide all unsettled questions,<a id="FNanchor_1116_1116" href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">1116</a> yet this confirmation
was destined to be effective for a period ludicrously brief.
A fresh treason of Maurice of Saxony undid all that his former
plotting had accomplished; and, while Henry II. was winning at
the expense of the empire the delusive title of Conqueror, Charles
found himself reduced to the hard necessity of restoring all that his
crooked policy had for so many years been devoted to extorting.
The Transaction of Passau, signed August 2d, 1552, gave full liberty
of conscience to the Lutheran states, until a national council or
Diet should devise means of restoring the unity of the church; and
in case such means could not be agreed upon, then the rights guaranteed
by the Transaction were granted in perpetuity.<a id="FNanchor_1117_1117" href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">1117</a> If Charles
was disposed to withdraw the concessions thus exacted of him, the
miserable siege of Metz and the increasing desire for abdication prevented
him from attempting it; and, at the Diet of Augsburg, in
1555, the states and cities of the Augsburg Confession were confirmed
in their right to enjoy the practices of their religion in peace.<a id="FNanchor_1118_1118" href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">1118</a></p>

<p>The long struggle thus was over. The public law of Germany at
last recognized the legality of the transactions based upon the Reformation,
and not the least in importance among those transactions
were the marriages of the ministers of Christ.</p>

THE ANGLICAN CHURCH.</h2>


<p>The abrogation of celibacy in England was a process of far more
perplexity and intricacy than in any other country which adopted
the Reformation. Perhaps this may be partially explained by the
temperament of the race, whose fierce spirit of independence made
them quick to feel and impatient to suffer the manifold evils of the
sacerdotal system, while their reverential conservatism rendered them
less disposed to adopt a radical cure than their Continental neighbors.</p>

<p>In no country of Europe had the pretensions of the papal power
been so resolutely set aside. In no country had ecclesiastical abuses
been more earnestly attacked or more persistently held up for popular
odium, and the applause which greeted all who boldly denounced
the shortcomings of priest and prelate shows how keenly the people
felt the evils to which they were exposed. William Langlande, the
monk of Malvern, was no heretic, yet he was unsparing in his
reprobation of the corruptions of the church:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Right so out of holi chirche,</div>
  <div class="verse">Alle yveles springeth,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>And he boldly prophesied the violent downfall of the whole fabric—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Right so, ye clerkes,</div>
  <div class="verse">For youre coveitise, er longe,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>But while the people greeted these assaults with the keenest pleasure,
they were attached to the old observances, and were in no haste to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
see the predictions of the poet fulfilled. A little sharp persecution
was sufficient to suppress all outward show of Lollardry, and there
was no chance in England for the fierce revolutionary enthusiasm
of the Taborites.</p>

<p>As the sixteenth century opened, John Colet did good work in
disturbing the stagnation of the schools by his contempt for the
petrified theological science of the schoolmen. His endeavor to
revert to the Scriptures as the sole source of religious belief was a
step in advance, while he was unsparing in his denunciations of the
corruptions which were as rife in the English church as we have seen
them elsewhere. Yet Colet, though at one time taxed with heretical
leanings, kept carefully within the pale of orthodoxy, and seems
never to have entertained the idea that the evils which he deplored
were to be attacked save by a renewal of the fruitless iteration of
obsolete canons.<a id="FNanchor_1121_1121" href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">1121</a> Perhaps, however, his friend and disciple, Sir
Thomas More, is the best example of this frame of mind in England’s
worthiest men, the besetting weakness of which made the
Anglican reformation a struggle whose vicissitudes can scarce be
said to have even yet reached their final development.</p>

<p>Before Luther had raised the standard of revolt, More keenly
appreciated the derelictions of the church, and allowed his wit to
satirize its vices with a freedom which showed the scantiest respect
for the sanctity claimed by its hierarchy.<a id="FNanchor_1122_1122" href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">1122</a> Yet when Luther came
with his heresies to sweep away all abuses, More’s gentle and tender<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
spirit was roused to a vulgarity of vituperation which earned for him
a distinguished place among the foul-mouthed polemics of the time,
and which is absolutely unfit for translation.<a id="FNanchor_1123_1123" href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">1123</a> As regards ascetic
observances, before the Lutheran movement, More seems to have
inclined towards condemning all practices that were not in accordance
with human nature, though he appears willing to admit that
there may be some special sanctity, though not wisdom, in conquering
nature.<a id="FNanchor_1124_1124" href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">1124</a> After the commencement of the Reformation, however,
his views underwent a reaction, and he not only defended monastic
vows, but he even went so far as to argue that by the recent marriages
of the Saxon reformers God had manifested his signal displeasure,
for in the old law true priests could be joined only to the
chastest virgins, while God permitted these false pastors to take to
wife none but public strumpets.<a id="FNanchor_1125_1125" href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">1125</a> If he accused Luther of sweeping
away the venerable traditions of man and of God,<a id="FNanchor_1126_1126" href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">1126</a> he showed how
conscientious was this rigid conservatism when he laid his head upon
the block in testimony for the principal creation and bulwark of tradition—the
papal supremacy.</p>

<p>A community thus halting between an acute perception of existing
evils and a resolute determination not to remove them was exactly
in the temper to render the great movement of the sixteenth century<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
as disastrous to themselves as possible. How to meet the inevitable
under such conditions was a problem which well might tax the
acutest intellect, and Wolsey, whose fate it was to undertake the
task, seems to have been inspired with more than his customary
audacious ingenuity in seeking the solution.</p>

<p>Wolsey himself was no ascetic, as the popular inscription over the
door of his palace—“Domus meretricium Domini Cardinalis”—sufficiently
attests. A visitation of the religious houses undertaken
in 1511 by Archbishop Warham had revealed all the old iniquities
without calling forth any remedy beyond an admonition.<a id="FNanchor_1127_1127" href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">1127</a> In 1518,
Wolsey himself had attempted a systematic reformation in his diocese
of York, and had revived the ancient canons punishing concubinage
among his priesthood;<a id="FNanchor_1128_1128" href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">1128</a> and in 1519 we find him applying to Leo X.
for a Bull conferring special power to correct the enormities of the
clergy.<a id="FNanchor_1129_1129" href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">1129</a> When, in 1523, he proposed a general visitation for the
reformation of the ecclesiastical body, Fox, Bishop of Winchester,
urged it as in the highest degree necessary, stating that he himself
had for three years been devoting all his energies to restore discipline
in his diocese, and that his efforts had been so utterly fruitless that
he had abandoned all hope of any change for the better.<a id="FNanchor_1130_1130" href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">1130</a> Cranmer,
indeed, in his “Confutation of Unwritten Verities,” had no hesitation
to say that “within my memory, which is above thirty years, and
also by the information of others that be twenty years elder than I,
I could never perceive or learn that any one priest, under the pope’s
kingdom, was ever punished for advoutry by his ordinary.”<a id="FNanchor_1131_1131" href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">1131</a> It
may readily be believed, therefore, that Wolsey fully recognized the
utter inefficiency of the worn-out weapons of discipline. Yet he was
too shrewd a statesman not to foresee that reformation from within
or from without must come, and, in taking the initiative, he commenced
by quietly and indirectly attacking the monastic orders.
As a munificent patron of letters, it was natural that he should
emulate Merton and Wykeham in founding a college at Oxford;
and “Cardinal’s College,” now Christ Church, became the lever
with which to topple over the vast monastic system of England.</p>

<p>The development of the plan was characteristically insidious.
By a Bull of April 3d, 1524 (confirmed by Henry, May 10th),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
Clement VII. authorized him to suppress the priory of St. Frediswood
at Oxford, and to remove the monks for the purpose of converting
it into a “Collegium Clericorum Seculorum.”<a id="FNanchor_1132_1132" href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">1132</a> This was
followed by a Bull, dated August 21st of the same year, empowering
him as legate to make inquisition and reformation in all religious
houses throughout the kingdom, to incarcerate and punish the
inmates, and to deprive them of their property and privileges, all
grants or charters to the contrary notwithstanding.<a id="FNanchor_1133_1133" href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">1133</a> The real purport
of this extraordinary commission is shown by the speedy issue
of yet another Bull, dated September 11th, conceding to him the
confiscation of monasteries to the amount of 3000 ducats annual
rental, for the endowment of his college, and alleging as a reason
for the measure that many establishments had not more than five or
six inmates.<a id="FNanchor_1134_1134" href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">1134</a></p>

<p>The affair was now fully in train, and proceeded with accelerating
momentum. On the 3d of July, 1525, Henry confirmed the incorporation
of the college; his letters-patent of May 1st, 1526, enumerate
eighteen monasteries suppressed for its benefit, while other
letters of May 10th grant seventy-one churches or rectories for its
support, and yet other grants are alluded to as made in letters which
have not been preserved.<a id="FNanchor_1135_1135" href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">1135</a> In 1528 these were followed by various
other donations of religious houses and manors; and during the
same year Wolsey founded another Cardinal’s College at Ipswich,
which became a fresh source of absorption.<a id="FNanchor_1136_1136" href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">1136</a></p>

<p>Had Henry VIII. entertained any preconceived design of suppressing
the religious houses, his impatient temper would scarcely
have allowed him to remain so long a witness of this spoliation
without taking his share and carrying the matter out with his
accustomed boldness and disregard of consequences. At length,
however, he claimed his portion, and procured from Clement a Bull
dated November 2d, 1528, conceding to him, for the benefit of the
old foundations of the King’s Colleges at Cambridge and Windsor,
the suppression of monasteries to the annual value of 8000 ducats.<a id="FNanchor_1137_1137" href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">1137</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
This was followed by another, a few days later, empowering Wolsey
and Campeggi, co-legates in the affair of Queen Katharine’s divorce,
to unite to other monasteries all those containing less than twelve
inmates—thus suppressing the latter, of which the number was very
large.<a id="FNanchor_1138_1138" href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">1138</a> Another Bull of the same date (November 12th) attacked
the larger abbeys, which had thus far escaped. It ordered the two
cardinals, under request from the king, to inquire into the propriety
of suppressing the rich monasteries enjoying over 10,000 ducats per
annum, for the purpose of converting them into bishoprics, on the
plea that the seventeen sees of the kingdom were insufficient for the
spiritual wants of the people.<a id="FNanchor_1139_1139" href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">1139</a> The report of the cardinals apparently
seconded the views of Henry, for Clement granted to them, May
29th, 1529, the power of creating and arranging bishoprics at their
discretion, and of sacrificing additional monasteries when necessary
to provide adequate revenues.<a id="FNanchor_1140_1140" href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">1140</a> It is probable that the monks who
had been unceremoniously deprived of their possessions did not in
all cases submit without resistance, for the Bull of November 12th,
1528, suppressing the smaller houses, was repeated August 31st,
1529, with the suggestive addition of authority to call in the assistance
of the secular arm.<a id="FNanchor_1141_1141" href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">1141</a></p>

<p>Wolsey was now tottering to his fall. Process against him was
commenced on October 9th, 1529, and on the 18th the Great Seal
was delivered to More. His power, however, had lasted long enough
to break down all the safeguards which had for so many centuries
grown around the sacred precincts of ecclesiastical property; and
the rich foundations which covered so large a portion of English territory
lay defenceless before the cupidity of a despot, who rarely
allowed any consideration, human or divine, to interfere with his
wishes, whose extravagance rendered him eager to find new sources
of supply for an exhausted treasury, and whose temper had been
aroused by the active support lent by the preaching friars to the
party of Queen Katharine in the affair of the divorce. Yet it is
creditable to Henry’s self-command that the blow did not fall sooner,
although it came at last.</p>

<p>It is not my province to enter into the details of Henry’s miserable
quarrel with Rome, which, except in its results, is, from every point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
of view, one of the most humiliating pages of history. The year
1532 saw the proclamation of the king commanding the support of
his subjects in the impending rupture, and the subscription of the
clergy to a paper which, with unparalleled servility, placed the whole
ecclesiastical constitution of the kingdom in his absolute power.<a id="FNanchor_1142_1142" href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">1142</a>
The following year his long-protracted divorce from Katharine of
Arragon was consummated; the annates were withdrawn from the
pope, and Henry assumed the title of Supreme Head of the Church
of England.<a id="FNanchor_1143_1143" href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">1143</a> In 1535 an obedient Parliament confirmed the acts
of the sovereign, and forbade the promulgation of any canons by
synods or convocations without his approval. The power of the
pope was abolished by proclamation; and Universities and prelates
rivalled each other in obsequiously transferring to Henry the reverence
due to Rome.<a id="FNanchor_1144_1144" href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">1144</a></p>

<p>The greater portion of the monasteries, which had already experienced
a foretaste of the wrath to come, hastened to proclaim their
adhesion to the new theological autocracy, and means not the most
gentle were found to persuade the remainder. The Carthusians of
the Charter House of London gave especial trouble, and the contest
between them and the king affords a vivid picture of the times.
There is something very affecting in the account given by Strype of
the humble but resolute resignation with which the prior and his
monks prepared themselves for martyrdom in vindication of the
papal supremacy.<a id="FNanchor_1145_1145" href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">1145</a> Their courage was soon put to the test. Between
the 27th of April and the 4th of August, 1535, the prior
and eleven of his monks were put to death with all the horrors of
the punishment for high treason;<a id="FNanchor_1146_1146" href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">1146</a> but neither this nor the efforts
of a new and more loyal prior were able to produce submission. In
1536 ten of the most unyielding were sent to other houses, where
several of them were subsequently executed, and in 1537 ten more
were thrown into Newgate, where nine of them died almost immediately—it
is to be presumed from the rigor of their confinement and
the foulness of the jail. In 1539 the few that remained were expelled;
the house was seized and used as an arsenal, until it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
given to Sir Edward North, who changed it into a residence, pulling
down the cloisters and converting the church into his parlor.<a id="FNanchor_1147_1147" href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">1147</a></p>

<p>The most conspicuous of the recalcitrants, however, was the powerful
order of the Franciscans. These refused the oath exacted of
them, causing no little trouble, and affording a cover for the intrigues
of that large body of the clergy who were dissatisfied with the innovations,
but afraid of open opposition.<a id="FNanchor_1148_1148" href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">1148</a> This precipitated the ruin
of the monastic orders, which could not, under any circumstances,
have been long delayed, and a general visitation was considered the
most effective means of encompassing their destruction. It was accordingly
ordered in 1535, and as their immorality and neglect of
their sacred duties had passed almost into a proverb, there was not
much difficulty in accumulating evidence to justify the measure.
The visitation was commanded to examine into the foundation, title,
history, condition of discipline, and number and character of the
inmates of all religious houses;<a id="FNanchor_1149_1149" href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">1149</a> and, as might have been expected,
the report disclosed a state of affairs which called for the immediate
removal of so foul a source of corruption and scandal. The visitors
had their work assigned them in advance, and they performed it
thoroughly; but we cannot assume that the evils which they
described were the creation of their own invention to gratify the
wishes and advance the purposes of their master.</p>

<p>One of the earliest abbeys visited was that of Langdon, where the
visitor, Dr. Leighton, suddenly breaking open the abbot’s door, found
him with his concubine, whose disguise as a man was discovered
secreted in a coffer. Leighton’s account of this little adventure
“scribullede this Satterday,” to his patron, Cromwell, is full of humor,
showing how thoroughly he enjoyed his success, and how fully he
was assured that the Secretary would likewise be gratified by it.<a id="FNanchor_1150_1150" href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">1150</a>
Bishop Burnet’s general summary of the result of the visitation
asserts that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span> “for the lewdness of the confessors of nunneries, and
the great corruption of that state, whole houses being found almost
all with child; for the dissoluteness of abbots and the other monks
and friars, not only with whores, but married women; and for their
unnatural lusts and other brutal practices; these are not fit to be
spoken of, much less enlarged on, in a work of this nature. The
full report of the visitation is lost, yet I have seen an extract of a
part of it, concerning 144 houses, that contains abominations in it
equal to any that were in Sodom.”<a id="FNanchor_1151_1151" href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">1151</a></p>

<p>The good bishop was not likely to extenuate what he had read, but
we yet may readily believe the truth of his account of it, for we cannot
assume that the charges were manufactured, like the accusations
against the Templars, for the purpose of serving as an excuse for
confiscation. The monasteries were not likely to have improved in
morals since Archbishop Morton described a similar condition of
affairs half a century earlier; nor is there any ground for imagining
them better than their Continental contemporaries, whose lapses were
the subject of animadversion by censors favorable to the monastic
system. Scarce anything, indeed, can be conceived worse than the
condition of the German convents as described in a document drawn
up by command of the Emperor Ferdinand to stimulate the sluggishness
of the council of Trent.<a id="FNanchor_1152_1152" href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">1152</a> A short account of “The Manner of
Dissolving the Abbeys,” by a contemporary,<a id="FNanchor_1153_1153" href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">1153</a> states the result of the
visitation in terms even stronger than those of Burnet, and Strype
gives some most suggestive extracts from the report of the visitation
of the diocese of Litchfield.<a id="FNanchor_1154_1154" href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">1154</a> Descriptions of the disorders of special
houses are very frequent in the private letters of the visitors and
commissioners to Cromwell,<a id="FNanchor_1155_1155" href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">1155</a> which may be the more readily believed,
since they also report favorably of many abbeys as being well governed,
and of the utmost benefit to their neighborhoods through their
generous hospitality and charity. It should be added that, in some
districts at least, the morals of the laity were no better than those
of the clergy.<a id="FNanchor_1156_1156" href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">1156</a> Nicander Nucius, who visited England about the
year 1545, in relating the suppression of the monastic orders, gives
as bad an account of their discipline as Burnet. He is not, of course,
an original authority, but, as an impartial observer, his statements
are worthy of consideration as reflecting the current views of society
at the period.<a id="FNanchor_1157_1157" href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">1157</a> It was evidently for the purpose of influencing public
opinion abroad that a book on the subject was written in Italian by
William Thomas, who summed up by stating that the visitors found
“not seven, but more than 700,000 deadly sins,” and who received
the reward of his vivacity by being put to death under Queen Mary.<a id="FNanchor_1158_1158" href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">1158</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span></p>

<p>A portion of the people were ready and eager to welcome the secularization
of the religious houses. Their views and arguments are
set forth with more force than elegance in the well-known “Beggars’
Petition,” which calculates that, besides the tithes, one-third of the
kingdom was ecclesiastical property, and that these vast possessions
were devoted to the support of a body of men who found their sole
serious occupation in destroying the peace of families and corrupting
the virtue of women. The economical injury to the commonwealth,
and the interference with the royal prerogative of the ecclesiastical
system, were argued with much cogency, and the king was entreated
to destroy it by the most summary methods. That any one should
venture to publish so violent an attack upon the existing church, at
a time when punishment so prompt followed all indiscretions of this
nature, renders this production peculiarly significant both as to the
temper of the educated portion of the people, and the presumed intentions
of the king.<a id="FNanchor_1159_1159" href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">1159</a></p>

<p>The visitation produced the desired effect. In 1536, after reading
the report, Parliament passed without opposition a bill suppressing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
for the benefit of the crown, all monasteries with less than twelve
inmates or possessing a revenue under £200 per annum. Three
hundred and seventy-six houses were swept away by this act, and the
“Court of Augmentations of the King’s Revenue” was established to
take charge of the lands and goods thus summarily escheated. The
rents which thus fell to the king were valued at £32,000 a year,
and the movable property at £100,000, while the commissioners
were popularly supposed to have been “as careful to enrich themselves
as to increase the king’s revenue.” Stokesley, Bishop of
London, remarked, concerning the transaction, that “these lesser
houses were as thorns soon plucked up, but the great abbots were
like putrefied old oaks, yet they must needs follow, and so would
others do in Christendom before many years were passed.” But
Stokesley, however true a prophet in the general scope of his observation,
was mistaken as to the extreme facility of eradicating the
humble thorns. The country was not as easily reconciled to the
change as the versatile, more intelligent, and less reverent inhabitants
of the cities. Henry, unluckily, not only had not abrogated
Purgatory by proclamation, but had specially recommended the continuance
of prayers and masses for the dead,<a id="FNanchor_1160_1160" href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">1160</a> and thousands were
struck with dread as to the future prospects of themselves and their
dearest kindred, when there should be few to offer the sacrifice of the
mass for the benefit of departed souls. The traveller and the mendicant,
too, missed the ever open door and the coarse but abundant
fare, which smoothed the path of the humble wayfarer. Discontent
spread widely, and was soon manifested openly. To meet this, most
of the lands were sold at a very moderate price to the neighboring
gentry, under condition of exercising free hospitality, to supply the
wants of those who had hitherto been dependent on conventual charity.<a id="FNanchor_1161_1161" href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">1161</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span></p>

<p>The plan was only partially successful, and soon another element
of trouble made itself apparent. Of the monks whose houses were
suppressed, those who desired to continue a monastic life were transferred
to the larger foundations, while the rest took “capacities,”<a id="FNanchor_1162_1162" href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">1162</a>
under promise of a reasonable allowance for their journey home.
They received only forty shillings and a gown, and with this slender
provision it was estimated that about ten thousand were turned adrift
upon the world, in which their previous life had incapacitated them
from earning a support. The result is visible in the act for the punishment
of “sturdy vagabonds and beggars,” passed by Parliament
in this same year, inflicting a graduated scale of penalties, of which
hanging was the one threatened for a third offence.<a id="FNanchor_1163_1163" href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">1163</a></p>

<p>This was a dangerous addition to society when discontent was
smouldering and ready to burst into flame. The result was soon
apparent. After harvest-time great disturbances convulsed the kingdom.
A rising, reported as consisting of twenty thousand men, in
Lincolnshire, was put down by the Duke of Suffolk with a heavy
force and free promises of pardon. In the North matters were even
more serious. The clergy there were less tractable than their southern
brethren, and some Injunctions savoring strongly of Protestantism
aroused their susceptibilities afresh. Unwilling to submit without
a struggle, they held a convocation, in which they denied the royal
supremacy and proclaimed their obedience to the pope. This was
rank rebellion, especially as Paul III., on the 30th of August, 1535,
had issued his Bull of excommunication against Henry, and self-preservation
therefore demanded the immediate suppression of the
recalcitrants. They would hardly, indeed, have ventured on assuming
a position of such dangerous opposition without the assurance
of popular support, nor were their expectations or labors disappointed.
The “Pilgrimage of Grace,” according to report, soon numbered
forty thousand men. Although Skipton and Scarboro’ bravely resisted
a desperate siege, the success of the insurgents at York, Hull,
and Pomfret Castle was encouraging, and risings in Lancashire, Durham,
and Westmoreland gave to the insurrection an aspect of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
most menacing character. Good fortune and skilful strategy, however,
saved the Duke of Norfolk and his little army from defeat; the
winter was rapidly approaching, and at length a proclamation of general
amnesty, issued by the king on the 9th of December, induced
a dispersion of the rebels. The year 1537 saw another rising in the
North, but this time it only numbered eight thousand men. Repulsed
at Carlisle, and cut to pieces by Norfolk, the insurgents were quickly
put down, and other disturbances of minor importance were even
more readily suppressed.<a id="FNanchor_1164_1164" href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">1164</a></p>

<p>Strengthened by these triumphs over the disaffected, Henry proceeded,
in 1537, to make the acknowledgment of papal authority a
crime liable to the penalties of a præmunire;<a id="FNanchor_1165_1165" href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">1165</a> and, as resistance was
no longer to be dreaded, he commenced to take possession of some
of the larger houses. These did not come within the scope of the
act of Parliament, and therefore were made the subject of special
transactions. The abbots resigned, either from having been implicated
in the late insurrections, or feeling that their evil lives would
not bear investigation, or doubtless, in many cases, from a clear perception
of the doom impending in the near future, which rendered it
prudent to make the best terms possible while yet there was time.
Thus, in these cases, the monks were generally pensioned with eight
marks a year, while some of the abbots secured a revenue of 400 or
500 marks.<a id="FNanchor_1166_1166" href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">1166</a> In an agreement which has been preserved, the monks
were to receive pensions varying from 53<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to £4 a year, according
to their age.<a id="FNanchor_1167_1167" href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">1167</a> In some cases, indeed, according to Bishop Latimer,
in a sermon preached before Edward VI., the royal exchequer
was relieved by finding preferment for most unworthy objects—“however
bad the reports of them were, some were made bishops
and others put into good dignities in the church; that so the king
might save their pensions that otherwise were to be paid them.”<a id="FNanchor_1168_1168" href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">1168</a>
An effectual means, moreover, of inducing voluntary surrenders was
by stopping their source of support, and thus starving them out.
Richard, Bishop of Dover, one of the commissioners in Wales, writes
to Cromwell, May 23d, 1538:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span> “I thinke before the yere be owt
ther schall be very fewe howsis abill to lyve, but schall be glade to
giffe up their howseis and provide for them selvys otherwise, for their
thei schall have no living.” In anticipation of the impending doom,
many of the abbots and priors had sold everything that was salable,
from lands and leases down to spits and kitchen utensils, leaving
their houses completely denuded. The letters of the commissioners
are full of complaints respecting this sharp practice, and of their
efforts to trace the property. Another mode of compelling surrenders
was by threatening the strict enforcement of the rules of the
order. Thus, in the official report of the surrender of the Austin
friars of Gloucester, we find the alternative given them, when “the
seyd freeres seyed ... as the worlde ys nowe they war not abull
to kepe them and leffe in ther howseys, wherfore voluntaryly they
gaffe ther howseys into the vesytores handes to the kynges use. The
vesytor seyd to them, ‘thynke nott, nor hereafter reportt nott, that
ye be suppresseyd, for I have noo such auctoryte to suppresse yow,
but only to reforme yow, wherfor yf ye woll be reformeyd, accordeyng
to good order, ye may contynew for all me.’ They seyd they
war nott abull to contynew,” whereupon they were ejected.<a id="FNanchor_1169_1169" href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">1169</a></p>

<p>In the year 1538 the work proceeded with increased rapidity, no
less than 158 surrenders of the larger houses being enrolled. Many
of the abbots were attainted of treason and executed, and the abbey
lands forfeited. Means not of the nicest kind were taken to increase
the disrepute of the monastic orders, and they retaliated in the same
way. Thus, the Abbot of Crossed-Friars, in London, was surprised
in the day time with a woman under the worst possible circumstances,
giving rise to a lawsuit more curious than decent;<a id="FNanchor_1170_1170" href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">1170</a> while, on the other
hand, the Abbess of Chepstow accused Dr. London, one of the visitors,
of corrupting her nuns.<a id="FNanchor_1171_1171" href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">1171</a> Public opinion, however, did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
move fast enough for the rapacity of those in power, and strenuous
exertions were made to stimulate it. All the foul stories that could
be found or invented respecting the abbeys were raked together; but
these proving insufficient, the impostures concerning relics and images
were investigated with great success, and many singular exposures
were made which gave the king fresh warrant for his arbitrary measures,
and placed the religious houses in a more defenceless position
than ever.<a id="FNanchor_1172_1172" href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">1172</a></p>

<p>Despite all this, in the session of 1539 all the twenty-eight parliamentary
abbots had their writs, and no less than twenty sat in the
House of Lords.<a id="FNanchor_1173_1173" href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">1173</a> Yet the influence of the court and the progress
of public opinion were shown in an act which confirmed the suppressions
of the larger houses not embraced in the former act, as
well as all that might thereafter be suppressed, forfeited, or resigned,<a id="FNanchor_1174_1174" href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">1174</a>
and May 9th, 1540, by special enactment, the ancient order of the
Knights of St. John was broken up, pensions being granted to the
grand prior and some of the principal dignitaries.<a id="FNanchor_1175_1175" href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">1175</a> These measures
consummated the ruin of the monastic system in England. Hence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>forth
it was altogether at the king’s mercy, and his character was
not one to temper power with moderation. In 1539 there are upon
record fifty-seven surrenders of the great abbeys,<a id="FNanchor_1176_1176" href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">1176</a> and a large number
in 1540, the good house of Godstow being the last of the great
monasteries to fall. Of the old monastic system this left only the
chantries, free chapels, collegiate churches, hospitals, &amp;c., which were
gradually absorbed during the succeeding years;<a id="FNanchor_1177_1177" href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">1177</a> until the necessities
of the king prompted a sweeping measure for their destruction. Accordingly
in 1545 a bill was brought in placing them all at his disposition.
There were some indications of opposition, but the king
pleaded the expenditures of the French and Scottish wars, and solemnly
promised his Parliament “that all should be done for the
glory of God and common profit of the realm,” whereupon it was
passed.<a id="FNanchor_1178_1178" href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">1178</a> It is computed that the number of monasteries suppressed
by these various measures was 645; of colleges, 90; of chantries
and free chapels, 2374; and of hospitals, 110.<a id="FNanchor_1179_1179" href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">1179</a></p>

<p>A vast amount of property thus passed into the hands of the court.
The clear yearly rental of the suppressed houses alone was rated at
£131,607 6<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>—an immense sum in those days; but Burnet
states that in reality it was almost tenfold the amount.<a id="FNanchor_1180_1180" href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">1180</a> Small as
may have been the good effected by these enormous possessions in
the hands of the monks, it was even more worthless under the management
of its new masters. Henry admitted the heavy responsibility
which he assumed in thus seizing the wealth which had been
dedicated to pious uses, and he entertained magnificent schemes for
devoting it to the public benefit, but his own necessities and the
grasping avarice of needy courtiers wrought out a result ridiculously
mean. Thus he designed to set aside a rental of £18,000 for the
support of eighteen “Byshopprychys to be new made.”<a id="FNanchor_1181_1181" href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">1181</a> For this
purpose he obtained full power from Parliament in 1539,<a id="FNanchor_1182_1182" href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">1182</a> and in
1540 he established one on the remains of the Abbey of Westminster.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
Those of Chester, Gloucester, and Peterboro’ were established in
1541, and in 1543 those of Oxford and Bristol,<a id="FNanchor_1183_1183" href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">1183</a> and one of them,
that of Westminster, was suppressed in 1550, leaving only five as
the result. The people were quieted by assurances that taxes would
be abrogated forever and the kingdom kept in a most efficient state
of defence; but subsidies and benevolences were immediately exacted
with more frequency and energy than ever.<a id="FNanchor_1184_1184" href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">1184</a> Splendid foundations
were promised for institutions of learning, but little was given; a
moderate sum was expended in improving the sea-ports, while broad
manors and rich farms were granted to favorites at almost nominal
prices; and the ill-gotten wealth abstracted from the church disappeared
without leaving traces except in the sudden and overgrown
fortunes of those gentlemen who were fortunate or prompt enough
to make use of the golden opportunity, and who to obtain them had
no scruple in openly tendering bribes and shares in the spoil to
Cromwell, the omnipotent favorite of the king.<a id="FNanchor_1185_1185" href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">1185</a> The complaints of
the people, who found their new masters harder than the old, may
be estimated from some specimens printed by Strype.<a id="FNanchor_1186_1186" href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">1186</a></p>

<p>If it be asked what became of the “holy idle thieves” and “sturdy
loobies” whom the Beggars’ Petition so earnestly desired to be thrown
upon the world, the answer may be found in the legislation of Edward
VI. A poor-law, the commencement of a series which to this day
has pressed upon England with ever-increasing weight, was enacted
in 1552.<a id="FNanchor_1187_1187" href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">1187</a> This tells its own story, but even more suggestive was
another bill for the suppression of vagabondage, the provisions of
which mark not only the inhumanity of the age, but the magnitude
of the evil caused by the violent acts of Henry. Every able-bodied
man loitering in any place for three days without working or offering
to work was held to be a vagabond. He was thereupon to be branded
on the breast with a letter V, and adjudged as a slave for two years
to any one who might bring him for that purpose before a justice
of the peace.<a id="FNanchor_1188_1188" href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">1188</a> Such was the ignominious end of the powerful and
wealthy monastic orders of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span></p>

<p>The monastic establishments of Ireland shared the same fate.
Rymer<a id="FNanchor_1189_1189" href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">1189</a> gives the text of a commission for the suppression of a nunnery
of the diocese of Dublin, in 1535. The insubordination of the
island, however, rendered it difficult to carry out the measure everywhere,
and finally, in 1541, it was accomplished by virtually granting
their lands to the native chieftains. These were good Catholics, but
they could not resist the temptation. They joined eagerly in grasping
the spoil, and the desirable political object was effected of detaching
them, for the time, from the foreign alliances with the Catholic
powers which threatened serious evils.<a id="FNanchor_1190_1190" href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">1190</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is a striking proof of Henry’s strength of will and intense individuality
of character, that, in thus tearing up by the roots the
whole system of monachism, he did not yield one jot to the powerful
section of his supporters who had pledged themselves to the logical
sequence of his acts, the abrogation of sacerdotal celibacy in general.
While every reason of policy and statesmanship urged him to grant
the privilege of marriage to the secular clergy, whom he forced to
transfer to him the allegiance formerly rendered to Rome; while his
chief religious advisers at home and his Protestant allies abroad used
every endeavor to wring from him this concession, he steadily and
persistently refused it to the end, and we can only guess whether his
firmness arose from conscientious conviction or from the pride of a
controversialist.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his immovable resolution on this point, his power
seemed ineffectual to stay the progress of the new ideas. An assembly
held by his order in May, 1530, to condemn the heretical doctrines
disseminated in certain books, shows how openly the advocates
of clerical marriage had promulgated their views while yet Wolsey
was prime minister and Henry gloried in the title of Defender of the
Faith. Numerous books were denounced in which celibacy was ridiculed,
its sanctity disproved, and its evil influences commented upon
in the most irreverent manner.<a id="FNanchor_1191_1191" href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">1191</a> These doctrines were sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
carried into practice, and the orthodox clergy had little ceremony in
visiting them with the sharpest penalties of the canons. It was
about this time that Stokesley, Bishop of London, condemned to
imprisonment for life Thomas Patmore, the incumbent of Hadham
in Hertfordshire, for encouraging his curate to marry and permitting
him subsequently to officiate; and the unfortunate man actually lay
for three years in gaol, until released by the intercession of Cranmer.<a id="FNanchor_1192_1192" href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">1192</a>
This severity offers a significant contrast to the lenity which punished
priestly incontinence with trifling fines and penalties, or sold licenses
to sin almost openly.<a id="FNanchor_1193_1193" href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">1193</a></p>

<p>If the reforming polemics were thus bold while Henry was yet
orthodox, it may readily be imagined how keenly they watched the
progress of his quarrel with the pope, and how loud became their
utterances as he gradually threw off his allegiance to Rome and persecuted
all who hesitated to follow in his footsteps. He soon showed,
however, that he allowed none to precede him, and that all consciences
were to be measured by the royal ell-wand. Thus his proceedings
against the Carthusians and Franciscans in 1534 were varied
by a proclamation directed against seditious books and priestly marriages.
As we have seen, some unions had taken place, and all who
had committed the indiscretion were deprived of their functions and
reduced to the laity, though the marriages seem to have been recognized
as valid. Future transgressions, moreover, were threatened
with the royal indignation and further punishment—words of serious
import at such a time and under such a monarch.<a id="FNanchor_1194_1194" href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">1194</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span></p>

<p>In spite of all this, the chief advisers of Henry did not scruple to
connive at infractions of the proclamation. Both Cranmer and
Cromwell favored the Reformation; the former was himself secretly
married, and even ventured to urge the king to reconsider his views
on priestly celibacy;<a id="FNanchor_1195_1195" href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">1195</a> while the latter, though, as a layman, without
any such personal motive, was disposed to relax the strictness of the
rule of celibacy. During the visitation of the monasteries, for instance,
the Abbot of Walden had little hesitation in confessing to
Ap Rice, the visitor, that he was secretly married, and asked to be
secured from molestation. The confidence thus manifested in the
friendly disposition of the vicar-general was satisfactorily responded
to. Cromwell replied, merely warning him to “use his remedy”
without, if possible, causing scandal.<a id="FNanchor_1196_1196" href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">1196</a> A singular petition, addressed
to him in 1536 by the secular clergy of the diocese of Bangor, illustrates
forcibly both the confidence felt in his intentions, and the
necessity of the Abbot of Walden’s “remedy” in the fearful state of
immorality which prevailed. There had been a visitation in which
the petitioners admit that many of them had been found in fault,
and as their women had been consequently taken away, they pray
the vicar-general to devise some means by which their consorts may
be restored. They do not venture to ask directly for marriage, but
decency forbids the supposition that they could openly request Cromwell
to authorize a system of concubinage. Nothing can be more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
humiliating than their confession of the relations existing between
themselves, as ministers of Christ, and the flocks entrusted to their
spiritual care. After pleading that without women they cannot keep
house and exercise hospitality, they add: “We ourselves shall be
driven to seek our living at ale-houses and taverns, for mansions
upon the benefices and vicarages we have none. <i>And as for gentlemen
and substantial honest men, for fear of inconvenience, knowing
our frailty and accustomed liberty, they will in nowise board us in
their houses.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_1197_1197" href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">1197</a></p>

<p>The tendencies thus exhibited by the king’s advisers called forth
the remonstrances of the conservatives. In June, 1536, the lower
house of convocation presented a memorial inveighing strongly against
the progress of heresy, and among the obnoxious opinions condemned
was “That it is preached and taught that all things awght to be in
comen and that Priests shuld have wiffes,” and they added that
books containing heretical opinions were printed “cum privilegio,”
were openly sold among the people, and were not condemned by
those in authority.<a id="FNanchor_1198_1198" href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">1198</a> Possibly it was in consequence of this that in
the following November Henry issued a circular letter to his bishops
in which he commanded them—“Whereas we be advertised that divers
Priests have presumed to marry themselves contrary to the
custom of our Church of England, Our Pleasure is, Ye shall make
secret enquiry within your Diocess, whether there be any such resiant
within the same or not”—and any such offenders who had presumed
to continue the performance of their sacred functions were
ordered to be reported to him or to be arrested and sent to London.<a id="FNanchor_1199_1199" href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">1199</a>
Curiously enough, there is no reference to the subject in the “Articles
devised by the Kinges Highnes Majestie to stablyshe Christen Quietnes
and Unitie amonge us,” issued by Henry in this year.<a id="FNanchor_1200_1200" href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">1200</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the ominous threat in the letter to the Bishops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
there appears, about this period, to have been great uncertainty in
the public mind respecting the state of the law and the king’s intentions.
Two letters happen to have been preserved, written within a
few days of each other, in June, 1537, to Cromwell, which reveal
the condition of opinion at the time. One of these complains that
the vicar of Mendelsham, in Suffolk, has brought home a wife and
children, whom he claims to be lawfully his own, and that it is permitted
by the king. Although “thys acte by hym done is in thys
countre a monstre, and many do growdge at it,” yet, not knowing
the king’s pleasure, no proceedings can be had, and appeal is therefore
made for authority to prosecute, lest “hys ensample wnponnyched
shall be occasion for other carnall evyll dysposed prestes to do in
lyke manner.” The other letter is from an unfortunate priest who
had recently married, supposing it to be lawful. The “noyse of the
peopull,” however, had just informed him that a royal order had
commanded the separation of such unions, and he had at once sent
his wife to her friends, threescore miles away. He therefore hastens
to make his peace, protesting that he had sinned through ignorance,
though he makes bold to argue that “yf the kyngys grace could have
founde yt laufull that prestys mught have byn maryd, they wold
have byn to the crowne dubbyll and dubbyll faythefull; furste in
love, secondly for fere that the byschoppe of Rome schuld sette yn
hys powre unto ther desolacyon.”<a id="FNanchor_1201_1201" href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">1201</a></p>

<p>It is evident from these letters that there was still a genuine popular
antipathy to clerical marriage, and yet that the royal supremacy
was so firmly established by Henry’s ruthless persecutions that this
antipathy was held subject to the pleasure of the court, and could at
any moment have been dissipated by proclamation. In fact, the only
wonder is that any convictions remained in the minds of those who
had seen the objects of their profoundest veneration made the sport
of avarice and derision. Stately churches torn to pieces, the stone
sold to sacrilegious builders, the lead put up at auction to the highest
bidder, the consecrated bells cast into cannon, the sacred vessels
melted down, the holy relics snatched from the shrines and treated
as old bones and offal, the venerated images burned at Smithfield—all
this could have left little sentiment of respect for worn-out religious
observances in those who watched and saw the sacrilege remain
unpunished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the reforming influences with which he was surrounded,
Henry sternly adhered to the position which he had assumed.<a id="FNanchor_1202_1202" href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">1202</a>
When, in 1538, the princes of the Schmalkaldic League offered to
place him at its head, and even to alter, if possible, the Augsburg
Confession so as to make it a common basis of union for all the elements
of opposition to Rome, Henry was well inclined to obtain the
political advantages of the position tendered him, but hesitated to
accept it until all doctrinal questions should be settled. The three
points on which the Germans insisted were the communion in both
elements, the worship in the vulgar tongue, and the marriage of the
clergy. In the Convocation of that year a series of questions was
submitted for decision embracing the contested points, and the clergy
decided in favor of celibacy, private masses, and communion in one
element.<a id="FNanchor_1203_1203" href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">1203</a> Thus sustained, Henry was firm, and the ambassadors of
the League spent two months in conferences with the English bishops
and doctors without result. On their departure (August 5th, 1538),
they addressed him a letter arguing the subjects in debate—the
refusal of the cup, private masses, and sacerdotal celibacy—to which
Henry replied at some length, defending his position on these topics
with no little skill and dexterity, and refusing his assent finally.<a id="FNanchor_1204_1204" href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">1204</a>
The reformers, however, did not yet despair, and the royal preachers
even ventured occasionally to debate the propriety of clerical marriage
freely before him in their sermons, but in vain.<a id="FNanchor_1205_1205" href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">1205</a> An epistle
which Melanchthon addressed him in April, 1539, arguing the same
questions again, had no better effect.<a id="FNanchor_1206_1206" href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">1206</a></p>

<p>In the spring of 1539 Henry renewed negotiations with the German
princes, and his envoys in soliciting another visit from deputies
of the League held out some vague promises of his yielding on the
point of celibacy. The Germans in turn, to show their earnest desire
for union with England, submitted a series of propositions, in which
they suggested that the marriage of priests might be left to the discretion
of the pope, and that if it were to be prohibited only persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
advanced in life should be ordained.<a id="FNanchor_1207_1207" href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">1207</a> Both parties, however, were
too firmly set in their opinions for accord to be possible. Notwithstanding
any seeming hesitation caused by the policy of the moment,
Henry’s mind was fully made up, and the consequences of endeavoring
to persuade him against his prejudices soon became apparent.
Even while the negotiations were in progress he had issued a series
of injunctions degrading from the priesthood all married clergy, and
threatening with imprisonment and his displeasure all who should
thereafter marry.<a id="FNanchor_1208_1208" href="#Footnote_1208_1208" class="fnanchor">1208</a> Argumentation confirmed his opinions, and he
proceeded to enforce them on his subjects in his own savage manner,
“for though on all other points he had set up the doctrines of the
Augsburg Confession,” yet on these he had committed himself as a
controversialist, and the worst passions of polemical authorship—the
true “odium theologicum”—acting through his irresponsible
despotism, rendered him the cruellest of persecutors. But a few
weeks after receiving the letter of Melanchthon, he answered it in
cruel fashion.</p>

<p>In May a new parliament met, chosen under great excitement, for
the people were inflamed on the subject of religion, and animosities
ran high. The principal object of the session was known to be a
settlement of the national church, and as the reformers were in a
minority against the court, the temper of the Houses was not likely
to be encouraging for them.<a id="FNanchor_1209_1209" href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">1209</a> On the 5th of May, a week after its
assembling, a committee was appointed, at the king’s request, to take
into consideration the differences of religious opinion. On the 16th,
the Duke of Norfolk, who was not a member of the committee,
reported that no agreement could be arrived at, and he therefore
laid before the House of Lords, for full discussion, articles embracing—1st.
Transsubstantiation; 2d. Communion in both kinds;
3d. Vows of Chastity; 4th. Private Masses; 5th. Sacerdotal Marriages;
and 6th. Auricular Confession. Cranmer opposed them
stoutly, arguing against them for three days, and especially endeavoring
to controvert the third and fifth, which enjoined celibacy, but his
efforts and those of his friends were vain, when pitted against the
known wishes of the king, who himself took an active part in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
debate, and argued in favor of the articles with much vigor. Under
such circumstances, the adoption of the Six Articles was a foregone
conclusion. On the 30th of May the chancellor reported that the
House had agreed upon them, and that it was the king’s pleasure
“that some penal statute should be enacted to compel all his subjects
who were in any way dissenters or contradicters of these articles to
obey them.” The framing of such a bill was intrusted to two committees,
one under the lead of Cranmer, the other under that of the
Archbishop of York, and they were instructed to lay their respective
plans before the king within forty-eight hours. Of course the report
of the Archbishop of York was adopted. Introduced on the 7th of
June, Cranmer again resisted it gallantly, but it passed both Houses
by the 14th, and received the royal assent on the 28th. It was
entitled “An Act for abolishing Diversity of Opinions in certain
Articles concerning Christian Religion,” and it stands as a monument
of the cruel legislation of a barbarous age. The Third Article
was “that Priests after the order of Priesthood might not marry by
the Law of God;” the Fourth, “that Vows of Chastity ought to be
observed by the Law of God,” and those who obstinately preached
or disputed against them were adjudged felons, to suffer death without
benefit of clergy. Any opposition, either in word or writing, subjected
the offender to imprisonment during the king’s pleasure, and
a repetition of the offence constituted a felony, to be expiated with
the life of the culprit. Priestly marriages were declared void, and
a priest persisting in living with his wife was to be executed as a
felon. Concubinage was punishable with deprivation of benefice and
property, and imprisonment, for a first offence; a second lapse was
visited with a felon’s death, while in all cases the wife or concubine
shared the fate of her partner in guilt. Quarterly sessions were provided,
to be held by the bishops and other commissioners appointed
by the king, for the purpose of enforcing these laws, and the accused
were entitled to trial by jury.<a id="FNanchor_1210_1210" href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">1210</a> Vows of chastity were only binding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
on those who had taken them of their own free will when over twenty-one
years of age.<a id="FNanchor_1211_1211" href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">1211</a> According to the Act, the wives of priests were
to be put away by June 24th, but on that day, as the act was not
yet signed, an order was mercifully made extending the time to
July 12th.<a id="FNanchor_1212_1212" href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">1212</a></p>

<p>Cranmer argued, reasonably enough, that it was a great hardship,
in the case of the ejected monks, to insist on the observance of the
vow of chastity, when those of poverty and obedience were dispensed
with, and when the unfortunates had been forcibly deprived of all
the advantages, safeguards, and protection of monastic life.<a id="FNanchor_1213_1213" href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">1213</a> The
matter, however, was not decided by reason, but by the whimsical
perversity of a self-opinionated man, who, unfortunately, had the
power to condense his polemical notions in the blood of his subjects.</p>

<p>To comprehend the full iniquity of this savage measure we must
remember the rapid progress which the new opinions had been
making in England for twenty years; the tacit encouragement given
them by the suppression of the religious houses, and by the influence
of the king’s confidential advisers; and the hopes naturally excited
by Henry’s quarrel with Rome and negotiations with the League of
Schmalkalden. In spite, therefore, of the comparatively mild punishments
hitherto imposed on priestly marriage, which were no doubt
practically almost obsolete, such unions may safely be assumed as
numerous. Even Cranmer himself, the primate of Henry’s church,
was twice married, his second wife, then living, the niece of Osiander,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
being kept under a decent veil of secrecy in his palace.<a id="FNanchor_1214_1214" href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">1214</a> When,
after his fruitless resistance to the Six Articles, the bill was passed,
he sent his wife to her friends in Germany, until the death of his
master enabled him to bring her back and acknowledge her openly;<a id="FNanchor_1215_1215" href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">1215</a>
but vast numbers of unfortunate pastors could not have had the
opportunity, and perhaps lacked the self-control, thus to arrange
their domestic affairs. Even the gentle Melanchthon was moved
from his ordinary equanimity, and ventured to address to his royal
correspondent a remonstrance expressing his horror of the cruelty
which could condemn to the scaffold a man whose sole guilt consisted
in not abandoning the wife to whom he had promised fidelity through
good and evil, before God and man—a cruelty which could find no
precedent in any code that man had previously dared to frame.<a id="FNanchor_1216_1216" href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">1216</a></p>

<p>As might be expected, numerous divorces of married priests followed
this Draconian legislation, and these divorces were held good
by the act of 1549, which, under Edward VI., granted full liberty
in the premises to ecclesiastics.<a id="FNanchor_1217_1217" href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">1217</a> Even Henry, however, began to
feel that he had gone too far, and the influence of Cromwell was
sufficient to prevent the harshest features of the law from being enforced
in all their odious severity, especially as the projected marriage
with Ann of Cleves and the alliance with the German Lutherans
rendered active persecution in the highest degree impolitic. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
the comedy of Henry’s fourth marriage culminated in the tragedy
of Cromwell’s ruin (June, 1540), the reactionary elements again
gathered strength. There can be no little doubt that the atrocity
of the law had greatly interfered with its efficient execution and had
aroused popular feeling, for now, although the Vicar-General was
removed, the Catholics passed with speedy alacrity a bill moderating
the act of the Six Articles, in so far as it related to marriage and
concubinage. For capital punishment was substituted the milder
penalty of confiscation to the king of all the property and revenue
of the offenders.<a id="FNanchor_1218_1218" href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">1218</a></p>

<p>The Six Articles, as thus modified, remained the law of England
during the concluding years of Henry’s reign, nor is it likely that
any one ventured to urge upon him seriously a relaxation of the
principles to which he had committed himself thus definitely. The
fall of Cromwell and the danger to which Cranmer was exposed for
several years were sufficient to insure him against troublesome remonstrants,
even if his increasing irritability and capriciousness had
not made those around him daily more alive to the danger of thwarting
or resisting his idlest humor. How little progress, indeed, the
Reformation had thus far made in England is shown in a letter
written in 1546 by John Hooper, afterwards Bishop of Gloucester
and Worcester, during the exile into which he was forced by the act
of the Six Articles—“Our king has destroyed the pope, but not
popery; he has expelled all the monks and nuns, and pulled down
their monasteries; he has caused all their possessions to be transferred
into his exchequer, and yet they are bound, even the frail
female sex, by the king’s command, to perpetual chastity. England
has at this time at least ten thousand nuns, not one of whom is
allowed to marry. The impious mass, the most shameful celibacy
of the clergy, the invocation of saints, auricular confession, superstitious
abstinence from meats, and purgatory, were never before held
by the people in greater esteem than at the present moment.”<a id="FNanchor_1219_1219" href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">1219</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span></p>

<p>On the 28th of January, 1547, Henry VIII. died, and Edward VI.
succeeded to the perilous throne. Not yet ten years of age, his government
of course received its direction from those around him, and
the rivalry between the protector Somerset and the chancellor Wriothesley,
Earl of Southampton, threw the former into the hands
of the progressives, as the latter was the acknowledged head of the
reactionary party. The ruin of Southampton and the triumph of
Somerset, strengthened by his successful campaign in Scotland, soon
began to develop their natural consequences on the religion of the
country. Under the auspices of Cranmer, a Convocation was assembled,
which was empowered to decide all questions in controversy.
When the primate was anxious to again enjoy the solace of his wife’s
company and to relieve both her and himself from the stigma of unlawful
marriage, it is easy to understand that the subject of celibacy
would receive early and appropriate attention; and so confident were
the reformers of success that they did not hesitate to enter into matrimony
without waiting for any formal sanction.<a id="FNanchor_1220_1220" href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">1220</a> Accordingly, on
December 17, 1547, a proposition was submitted to the effect that
all canons, statutes, laws, decrees, usages, and customs, interfering
with or prohibiting marriage, should be abrogated, and it was carried
by a vote of 53 to 22. No time was lost. Two days afterwards a
bill was introduced in the Commons permitting married men to be
priests and to hold benefices. It was received with so much favor
that it was read twice the same day, and on the 21st it was sent up
to the Lords; but in the Upper House it raised debates so prolonged
that, as the members were determined to adjourn before Christmas,
it was laid aside. This might be the more readily agreed to, since
on the 23d an act was approved which abolished numerous severe
laws of the former reign, including the statute of the Six Articles,
and was immediately followed by another granting the use of the
cup to the laity and prohibiting private masses.<a id="FNanchor_1221_1221" href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">1221</a></p>

<p>The repeal of the Six Articles left the marriage of the clergy
subject to the previous laws of Henry, imposing on it various pains
and penalties, but with the votes recorded in Convocation and Parlia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>ment,
it is not likely that much vigor was displayed in their enforcement.
Those interested could thus afford to await the reassembling
of the Houses, which did not take place until November 24, 1548,
but they claimed the reward of their patience by an early hearing in
the session. On the 3d of December a bill was introduced, similar
to that of the previous year, rendering married men eligible to the
priesthood; it passed second reading on the 5th, and third reading
on the 6th. Apparently encouraged by the favorable reception
accorded to it, the friends of the measure resolved on demanding
further privileges. The bill was therefore laid aside, and on the
next day a new one was presented which granted the additional
liberty of marriage to those already in orders. It conceded to the
established opinions the fact that it were better that the clergy should
live chaste and single, yet, “as great filthiness of living had followed
on the laws that compelled chastity and prohibited marriage,” therefore
all laws and canons inhibiting sacerdotal matrimony should be
abolished. This bill, after full discussion, was read a second and
third time on the 10th and 12th, and was sent up to the Lords on
the 13th. Again the Upper House was in no haste to pass it. It
lay on the table until February 9, 1549, when it was stoutly contested,
and, after being recommitted, it finally passed on the 19th,
with the votes of nine bishops recorded against it.<a id="FNanchor_1222_1222" href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">1222</a></p>

<p>Cranmer and his friends were now at full liberty to establish the
innovation by committing the clergy individually to marriage, and
by enlisting the popular feeling in its support. During the discussion
they had not been idle. Much controversial writing had occurred
on both sides, in which Poynette, afterwards Bishop of Winchester,
took an active part, while Bale, Bishop of Ossory, distinguished
himself on the same side by raking together all the foul stories
that could be collected concerning the celibate clergy—a scandalous
material not likely to be lacking in either quantity or quality.
Burnet declares that no law passed during the reign of Edward
excited more contradiction and censure, and the matrimonialists soon
found that, even with the act of parliament in their favor, their course
was not wholly a smooth one. Cranmer ordered a visitation in his
province, and directed as one of the points for inquiry and animadversion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
“Whether any do contemn married priests, and, for that
they be married, will not receive the communion or other sacraments
at their hands,”<a id="FNanchor_1223_1223" href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">1223</a> which distinctly reveals the difficulties encountered
in eradicating the convictions of centuries from the popular mind.
Sanders says, and with every appearance of probability, that the
Archbishop of York united with Cranmer in ordering a visitation
of the whole kingdom, during which the visitors investigated particularly
the morals of the clergy, and used every argument to impel
them to marriage, not only declaring celibacy to be most dangerous
to salvation, but intimating that all who adhered to it would be
regarded as papists and enemies of the king.<a id="FNanchor_1224_1224" href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">1224</a> The active interest
which Cranmer took in the question is manifested by the fact that
when Dr. Richard Smith, who had fled to Scotland in consequence
of having endeavored to stir up a tumult at Oxford against Peter
Martyr, desired to make his peace and return, the inducement which
he offered to the Archbishop of Canterbury to obtain for him the
king’s pardon was that he would write a book in favor of priestly
marriage, as he had previously done against it.<a id="FNanchor_1225_1225" href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">1225</a></p>

<p>The Reformers speedily found that they were not to escape without
opposition. The masses of the people throughout England were in
a state of discontent. The vast body of abbey lands acquired by
the gentry and now inclosed bore hard upon many; the raising of
rents showed that secular landlords were less charitable than the
ancient proprietors of the soil; the increase of sheep-husbandry
threw many farm laborers out of employ;<a id="FNanchor_1226_1226" href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">1226</a> and the savage enactments,
already alluded to, against the unfortunate expelled monks
show how large an element of influential disaffection was actively at
work in the substratum of society. Those priests who disapproved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
of the rapid Protestantizing process adopted by the court could
hardly fail to take advantage of opportunities so tempting, and they
accordingly fanned the spark into a flame. The enforcement of the
new liturgy, on Whitsunday, 1549, seemed the signal of revolt.
Numerous risings took place, which were readily quelled, until one
in Devonshire assumed alarming proportions. Ten thousand men
in arms made demands for relief in religious as well as temporal
matters. Lord Russel, unable to meet them in the field, endeavored
to gain time by negotiation, and offered to receive their complaints.
These were fifteen in number, of which several demanded the restoration
of points of the old religion, and one insisted on the revival
of the Six Articles. On their refusal, another set was drawn up,
in which not only were the Six Articles called for, but also a special
provision enforcing the celibacy of the clergy. This was likewise
rejected; but during the delay another rising occurred in Norfolk,
reckoned at twenty thousand men, and yet another of less formidable
dimensions in Yorkshire. Russel finally scattered the men of Devon,
while the Earl of Warwick succeeded in suppressing the rebels of
Norfolk, when the promise of an amnesty caused the Yorkshiremen
to disperse.<a id="FNanchor_1227_1227" href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">1227</a></p>

<p>The question of open resistance thus was settled. Cranmer and
his friends had now leisure to consolidate their advantages and
organize a system that should be permanent. In 1551, he and
Ridley prepared with great care a series of forty-two articles, embodying
the faith of the church of England, which was adopted by
the convocation in 1552, and was ordered to be signed by all men
in orders and all candidates for ordination.<a id="FNanchor_1228_1228" href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">1228</a> Burnet speaks of it
as bringing the Anglican doctrine and worship to perfection. It
remained unaltered during the rest of Edward’s reign, and under
Elizabeth it was only modified verbally in the recension which resulted
in the famous Thirty-nine Articles—the foundation stone of
the Episcopalian edifice. Of these forty-two articles, the thirty-first
declared that “Bishops, priests, and deacons are not commanded
by God’s law to vow the estate of a single life or to abstain from
marriage.”<a id="FNanchor_1229_1229" href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">1229</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span></p>

<p>The canon law had thus invested the marriage of the clergy with
all the sanctity that the union of man and wife could possess. Yet
still the deep-seated conviction of the people as to the impropriety
of such proceedings remained, troubling the repose of those who had
entered into matrimony, and doubtless operating as a restraint upon
the numbers of the imitators of Cranmer. Among the interrogatories
drawn up by John Hooper for the visitation of his diocese of
Gloucester, in 1552, is one which enquires whether any midwife
refuses to attend the confinement of women who are married to
ministers of the church<a id="FNanchor_1230_1230" href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">1230</a>—a suggestion which indicates how rooted
was the popular aversion to such matches. If Strype’s description
of the clergy of the period, indeed, be correct, there was nothing in
the character of the body to overcome the popular aversion in consideration
of its purity and devotion to its sacred duties.<a id="FNanchor_1231_1231" href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">1231</a> The act
of 1549 had to a certain extent justified these prejudices by admitting
the preferableness of a single life in the ministers of Christ, and
it was resolved to remove every possible stigma by a solemn declaration
of parliament. A bill was therefore prepared and speedily
passed (Feb. 10th, 1552), which reveals how strong was the popular
opposition, and how uncertain the position of the wives and children
of the clergy. It declares “That many took occasion, from the
words in the act formerly made about this matter, to say that it was
only permitted, as usury and other unlawful things were, for the
avoidance of greater evils, who thereupon spoke slanderously of such
marriages, and accounted the children begotten in them to be bastards,
to the high dishonor of the King and Parliament, and the
learned clergy of the Realm, who had determined that the laws
against priests’ marriages were most unlawful by the law of God;
to which they had not only given their assent in the Convocation,
but signed it with their hands. These slanders did also occasion
that the Word of God was not heard with due reverence.” It was
therefore enacted “That such marriages made according to the rules
prescribed in the Book of Service should be esteemed good and valid,
and that the children begot in them should be inheritable according
to law.”<a id="FNanchor_1232_1232" href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">1232</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
A still further confirmation of the question was designed in a body
of ecclesiastical law which was for several years in preparation by
various commissions appointed for the purpose. In this it was proposed
to make the abrogation of celibacy even more distinctly a
matter of faith, for, in the second Title, among the various heresies
condemned is that which, through the suggestion of the Devil,
asserts that admission to holy orders takes away the right to marry.
This work, however, though completed, had not yet received the
royal assent, when the death of Edward VI. caused it to pass out
of sight until 1571, when it was printed by Foxe and brought to
the attention of Parliament, but was laid aside owing to the opposition
of Queen Elizabeth.<a id="FNanchor_1233_1233" href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">1233</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If the Protestants indulged in any day-dreams as to the permanency
of their institutions, they were not long in finding that a
change of rulers was destined to cause other changes disastrous to
their hopes. Even the funeral of Edward, on the 8th of August,
1553, afforded them a foretaste of what was in store. Although
Cranmer insisted that the public ceremonies in Westminster Abbey
should be conducted according to the reformed rites, Queen Mary,
still resident in the Tower, had private obsequies performed with
the Roman ritual, where Gardiner celebrated mortuary mass in
presence of the queen and some four hundred attendants. When
the incense was carried around, after the Gospel, it chanced that the
chaplain who bore it was a married man, and the zealous Dr. Weston
snatched it from him, exclaiming, “Shamest thou not to do thine
office, having a wife as thou hast? The queen will not be censed
by such as thou!”<a id="FNanchor_1234_1234" href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">1234</a></p>

<p>Trifling as was this incident, it foreboded the wrath to come.
Though Mary was not crowned until October 1st, she had issued
writs for a parliament to assemble on the 10th, and, as an entire
change in the religious institutions of the country was intended, we
may not uncharitably believe the assertion that every means of influence
and intimidation was employed to secure the return of reactionary
members. These efforts were crowned with complete success.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
The Houses had not sat for three weeks, when a bill was sent down
from the Lords repealing all the acts of Edward’s reign concerning
religion, including specifically those which permitted the marriage
of priests and legitimated their offspring; and after a debate of six
days it passed the Commons.<a id="FNanchor_1235_1235" href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">1235</a></p>

<p>The effect of this was, of course, to revive the statute of the Six
Articles, and to place all married priests at the mercy of the queen;
and as soon as she felt that she could safely exercise her power, she
brought it to bear upon the offenders. A day or two after the dissolution
of parliament she commenced by issuing a proclamation inhibiting
married priests from officiating.<a id="FNanchor_1236_1236" href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">1236</a> The Spanish marriage
being agreed upon and the resultant insurrection of Sir Thomas
Wyatt being suppressed, Mary recognized her own strength, and
her Romanizing tendencies, which had previously been somewhat
restrained, became openly manifested. On the 4th of March, 1554,
she issued a letter to her bishops, of which the object was to restore
the condition of affairs under Henry VIII., except that the royal
prerogatives as head of the church were expressly disavowed. It
contained eighteen articles, to be strictly enforced throughout all
dioceses. Of these the seventh ordered that the bishops should by
summary process remove and deprive all priests who had been married
or had lived scandalously, sequestrating their revenues during
the proceedings. Article VIII. provided that widowers, or those who
promised to live in the strictest chastity, should be treated with leniency,
and receive livings at some distance from their previous abode,
being properly supported meanwhile; while Article IX. directed
that those who suffered deprivation should not on that account be
allowed to live with their wives, and that due punishment should be
inflicted for all contumacy.<a id="FNanchor_1237_1237" href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">1237</a></p>

<p>No time was lost in carrying out these regulations. By the 9th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
of the same month, a commission was already in session at York,
which cited the clergy to appear before it on the 12th. From an
appeal which is extant, by one Simon Pope, rector of Warmington,
it appears that men were deprived without citation or opportunity
for defence;<a id="FNanchor_1238_1238" href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">1238</a> and that this was not infrequent is probable from the
proceedings commenced against offenders of the highest class, designed
and well fitted to strike terror into the hearts of the humbler
parsons. On the 16th a commission was issued to the Bishops of
Winchester (Stephen Gardiner), London (Bonner), Durham, St.
Asaphs, Chichester, and Landaff, to investigate the cases of the
Archbishop of York and the Bishops of St. Davids, Chester, and
Bristol, who, according to report, had given a most pernicious example
by taking wives, in contempt of God, to the damage of their
own souls, and to the scandal of all men. Any three of the commissioners
were empowered to summon the accused before them, and
to ascertain the truth of the report without legal delays or unnecessary
circumlocution. If it were found correct, then they were
authorized to remove the offenders at once and forever from their
dignities, and also to impose penance at discretion. This was scant
measure of justice, considering that the marriage of these prelates
had been contracted under sanction of law, and, if that law had
recently been repealed, that at least the option of conforming to the
new order of things could not decently be denied; yet even this
mockery of a trial was apparently withheld, for the congé d’élire for
their successors is dated March 18th, only two days after the commission
was appointed.<a id="FNanchor_1239_1239" href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">1239</a></p>

<p>During the summer the bishops went on their visitations. The
articles prepared by Bonner for his diocese are extant, among which
we find directions to inquire particularly of the people whether their
pastors are married, and, if separated, whether any communication
or intercourse takes place between them and their wives; also,
whether any one, lay or clerical, ventures to defend sacerdotal
matrimony.<a id="FNanchor_1240_1240" href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">1240</a> Few of the weaker brethren could escape an inquisition
so searching as this, and though some controversy arose, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
a few tracts were printed in defence of priestly marriage,<a id="FNanchor_1241_1241" href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">1241</a> such men
as Bonner were not likely to shrink from the thorough prosecution
of the work which they had undertaken.</p>

<p>When the convocation assembled in this year, it was therefore to
be expected that only orthodox opinions would find expression.
Accordingly, the lower House presented to the bishops an humble
petition praying for the restoration of the old usages, among the
points of which are requests that married priests be forcibly separated
from their wives, and that those who endeavor to abandon
their order be subjected to special animadversion. This clause shows
that many unfortunates preferred to give up their positions and lose
the means of livelihood, rather than quit the wives to whom they
had sworn fidelity, demanding, as we shall see, much subsequent
conflicting legislation. The social complications resulting from the
change of religion are also indicated in the request that married
nuns may be divorced, and that the pretended wives of priests have
full liberty to marry again.<a id="FNanchor_1242_1242" href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">1242</a></p>

<p>Everything being thus prepared, the purification of the church
from married heretics was prosecuted with vigor. Archbishop Parker
states that there were in England some 16,000 clergymen, of whom
12,000 were deprived on this account, many of them most summarily;
some on common report, without trial, others without being summoned
to appear before their judges, and others again while lying in
jail for not obeying the summons. Some renounced their wives, and
were yet deprived, while those who were deprived were also, as we
have seen, forced to part with their wives. We can readily believe
that the most ordinary forms of justice were set aside, in view of the
illegal and indecorous haste of the proceedings against the married
bishops described above, but Parker’s estimate of the number of
sufferers is greatly exaggerated. According to Dr. Tanner, in the
diocese of Norfolk—then estimated at one-eighth of the whole kingdom—there
were only 335 deprivations on this account; and at
York, from April 27th to December 20th, 1554, there were only
fifty-one ejected.<a id="FNanchor_1243_1243" href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">1243</a> It is probable, therefore, that the list throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
England would not exceed three thousand; yet when to these are
added the hosts who no doubt succeeded in retaining their positions
by a compliance with the law in quietly putting away their wives,<a id="FNanchor_1244_1244" href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">1244</a>
it will be seen that the privilege of marriage had been eagerly improved
by the clergy, and that an amount of misery which it would
be difficult to estimate was caused by the enforcement of the canons.</p>

<p>The proceedings in the case of John Turner, rector of St. Leonard’s,
London, would seem to show that the extremity of humiliation was
inflicted on these unfortunates. Cited on March 16th to answer to
the charge of being a married man, he confessed the accusation, and
we find him on the 19th condemned to lose his benefice and be suspended
from all priestly functions, to be divorced from his wife, and to
undergo such further punishment as the canons required. The sentence
of divorce soon followed, and on May 14th he was obliged to
do penance in his late church in Eastcheap, holding a lighted candle
in his hand and solemnly declaring to the assembled congregation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>—“Good
people, I am come hither, at this present time, to declare
unto you my sorrowful and penitent heart, for that, being a priest,
I have presumed to marry one Amy German, widow; and, under
pretence of that matrimony, contrary to the canons and custom of
the universal church, have kept her as my wife, and lived contrary
to the canons and ordinances of the church, and to the evil example
of good Christian people; whereby now, being ashamed of my former
wicked living here, I ask Almighty God mercy and forgiveness, and
the whole Church, and am sorry and penitent even from the bottom
of my heart therefore. And in token hereof, I am here, as you see,
to declare and show unto you my repentance: that before God, on
the latter day, you may testify with me of the same. And I most
heartily and humbly pray and desire you all, whom by this evil
example doing I have greatly offended, that for your part you will
forgive me, and remember me in your prayers, that God may give
me grace, that hereafter I may live a continent life, according to His
laws and the godly ordinances of our mother the holy Catholic
Church, through and by His grace. And do here, before you all,
openly promise for to do during my life.”<a id="FNanchor_1245_1245" href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">1245</a> Such scenes as these
were well calculated to produce the effect desired upon the people,
but we can only guess at the terrorism which was requisite to force
educated and respectable men to submit to such degradation.</p>

<p>All this was done by the royal authority, wielding the ecclesiastical
power usurped by Henry VIII. Strictly speaking, it was highly
irregular and uncanonical, but as the papal supremacy was yet in
abeyance it could not be accomplished otherwise. At last, however,
the kingdom was ripe for reconciliation with Rome. In calling the
parliament of 1554, the queen issued a circular letter to the sheriffs
commanding them to admonish the people to return members “of the
wise, grave, and Catholic sort.”<a id="FNanchor_1246_1246" href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">1246</a> Her wishes were fulfilled, and ere
the year was out Cardinal Pole was installed with full legatine
powers, and Julius III. had issued his Bull of Indulgence, reuniting
England to the church from which she had been violently severed.<a id="FNanchor_1247_1247" href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">1247</a>
An obedient parliament lost no time in repealing all statutes adverse
to the claims of the Holy See, but its subserviency had limits, and
one class largely interested in the reforms of Henry had sufficient
influence to maintain its heretical rights. The church lands granted
or sold to laymen were not revendicated. Indeed, the queen, in her
call for the parliament, had felt it necessary to contradict the rumour
that she and Philip intended the “alteration of any particular Man’s
Possessions.” Though the transactions by which they had been
acquired were wholly illegal; though no duration of possession could
bar the imprescriptible rights of the church, yet the nobles and
country gentlemen enriched by the spoliation were too numerous and
powerful, and the reclamation of the kingdom was too important, to
incur any peril by unseasonably insisting on reparation for Henry’s
injustice. The abbatial manors and rich priories, the chantries, hospitals,
and colleges were therefore left in the impious hands of those
who had been fortunate enough to secure them,<a id="FNanchor_1248_1248" href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">1248</a> and the miserable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
remnants of the religious orders were left to the conscience of the
queen, who made haste to get rid of such fragments of the spoil as
had been retained by the crown.<a id="FNanchor_1249_1249" href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">1249</a></p>

<p>Whatever tacit understanding there may have been on this delicate
subject between Queen Mary and Pope Julius was not assented to by
the imperious Caraffa who shortly afterwards ascended the chair of
St. Peter. Elected May 23, 1555, he lost no time in proclaiming
the imprescriptible rights of the church, and by his Bull “Injunctum
nobis” issued June 21st, he pronounced null and void “de apostolicæ
potestatis plenitudine” all transactions by which ecclesiastical possessions
had passed into the hands of laymen, who were duly threatened
with excommunication for prolonged attempts to hold their
unhallowed acquisitions.<a id="FNanchor_1250_1250" href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">1250</a> The effort of course was fruitless, but the
spirit in which the English protestants watched the apparent opening
of a breach between England and Rome is well expressed in a letter
of Aug. 23, 1555, from Sir Richard Morrison to Henry Bullinger—“This
anti-Paul, Paul of the apostasy, the servant of the devil, this
antichrist newly created at Rome, thinks it but a very small plunder
that is offered to him, that he is again permitted in England to
tyrannise over our consciences, unless the revenues be restored to the
monasteries, that is, the pigsties; the patrimony, as he calls it, of the
souls that are now serving in the filth of purgatory. Our ambassadors,
who went to Rome for the purpose of bringing back the wolf
upon the sheep of Christ, are now with the emperor, and bring us
these demands of the chief pontiff: God grant that he may urge
them in every possible way.”<a id="FNanchor_1251_1251" href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">1251</a> The hopes of the reformers however
were disappointed, for Paul IV. gave way, and on the reassembling
of Parliament, Oct. 23, 1555, a Bull was read by which the pope
assented to the arrangement agreed to by Cardinal Pole, confirming
the church lands to their new possessors.<a id="FNanchor_1252_1252" href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">1252</a></p>

<p>Cardinal Pole, indeed, was not remiss in giving the sanction of the
papal authority to all that had been done. Convoking a synod, he
issued, in 1555, his Legatine Constitutions, by which all marriages
of those included in the prohibited orders were declared null and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
void. Such apostates were ordered to be separated by ecclesiastical
censures and by whatever legal processes might be required; all who
dared to justify such marriages or to obstinately remain in their unholy
bonds were to be rigorously prosecuted and punished according
to the ancient canons, which were revived and declared to be in full
force in order to prevent similar scandals for the future.<a id="FNanchor_1253_1253" href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">1253</a> As the
queen by special warrant had decreed that all canons adopted by
synods should have the full effect of laws binding on the clergy,
these constitutions at once restored matters to their pristine condition.
It was doubtless in order to mark in the most conspicuous
manner his detestation of clerical marriage that Pole descended to
the pettiness of ordering the body of Peter Martyr’s wife to be dug
up from its resting-place, near the tomb of St. Frideswide in Christ’s
Church, Oxford, and to be buried in a dung-hill.<a id="FNanchor_1254_1254" href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">1254</a></p>

<p>It was easy to pass decrees; it was doubtless gratifying to eject
married priests by the thousand and to grant their livings to hungry
reactionaries or to the crowd of needy churchmen whom Italy had
ever ready to supply the spiritual wants and collect the tithes of the
faithful. All this was readily accomplished, but the difficulty lay in
overcoming the eternal instincts of human nature. The struggle to
effect this commenced at once.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, hardly to be expected that those who had entered
into matrimony with the full conviction of its sanctity would willingly
abandon all intercourse with their wives, although they might yield
a forced assent to the pressure of the laws, the prospect of poverty,
and the certainty of infamous punishment. Accordingly we find
that the necessity at once arose of watching the “reconciled” priests,
who continued to do in secret what they could no longer practise
openly. Some, indeed, found the restrictions so onerous that they
endeavored to release themselves from the bonds of the church rather
than to submit longer to the separation from their wives; and this
apparently threatened so great a dearth in the ranks of the clergy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
that Cardinal Pole, as Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1556, forbade
the withdrawal of any one from the mysteries and functions of the
altar, under pain of the law.<a id="FNanchor_1255_1255" href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">1255</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this legislation, royal, parliamentary, and
ecclesiastical, the question refused to settle itself, and the Convocation
which assembled on the 1st of January, 1557, was obliged to publish
an elaborate series of articles, which demonstrated that previous
enactments had either not been properly observed or that they had
failed in effecting their purpose. Thus the prohibition of marriage
to those in priests’ orders was formally renewed. Such of the married
clergy, who had undergone penance and had been restored, as
still persisted in holding intercourse with their separated wives, were
to be deprived irrevocably of their office, and only to be admitted to
lay communion—thus reversing the policy of Cardinal Pole’s injunctions.
As all priests who had been married were obnoxious to the
people, they were to be removed from the priesthood; or, at least,
on account of the scarcity of ministers, to act only as curates, and
to be incapable of holding benefices until a thorough course of penance
should have washed away their sins. Even then, in no case
were they to officiate in the dioceses wherein they had been married,
but were to be removed to a distance of at least sixty miles, and
if detected in any intercourse with their wives, they were to incur
severe punishment, a single interchange of words being sufficient to
call down the penalty. To insure the observance of these rules, all
synods were directed to make special inquiry into the lives of these
unfortunates, who were thus to exist under a perpetual surveillance,
at the mercy of inimical spies and informers.<a id="FNanchor_1256_1256" href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">1256</a> This may, perhaps,
be considered a moderate expiation for men who, in those days of
fierce religious convictions, possessed that flexibility of faith which
enabled them to change their belief with every dynastic accident.</p>

<p>If the rigid rules now introduced were successful in nothing else,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
they at all events succeeded in restoring the old troubles with the
old canons. Denied the lawful gratification of human instincts, the
clergy immediately returned to the habits which had acquired for
them so much odium in times past, and the rulers of the church at
once found themselves embarked in the sempiternal struggle with
immorality in all its shapes and disguises. If the scandalous chronicles
of the period be worthy of credit, neither Gardiner nor Bonner,
nor other active promoters of the canons, were without the visible
evidences of the frailty of the flesh;<a id="FNanchor_1257_1257" href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">1257</a> and though they were above
the reach of correction, the minor clergy were not so fortunate. The
Convocation of 1557, which issued the stringent regulations just
quoted, was also obliged to promulgate articles concerning the residence
of women with priests, and the punishment of licentiousness,
similar to those which we have seen reproduced so regularly for ten
centuries. Cardinal Pole, too, in his visitation of the same year,
directed inquiries to be made on these points in a manner which
shows that they were existing, and not merely anticipated evils.<a id="FNanchor_1258_1258" href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">1258</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fortunately for the character of the Anglican clergy, the reign
of reaction was short. On the 17th of November, 1558, Queen
Mary closed her unhappy life, and Cardinal Pole followed her within
sixteen hours. The Marian persecution had been long enough and
sharp enough to give to heresy all the attractions of martyrdom,
thus increasing its fervor and enlarging its circle of earnest disciples;
and the sudden termination of that persecution, before it had time
to accomplish its work of extirpation, left the reformers more zealous
and dangerous than ever. Heresy had likewise been favored by the
discontent of the people arising from the disastrous and expensive
war with France, which aided the improvident restoration of the
church lands in impoverishing the exchequer and in rendering necessary
heavy subsidies from the nation, repaid only by cruelty and
misfortune. Dread of Spanish influence also had a firm hold of the
imagination of the masses, while the church itself was especially
unpopular, as the conviction was general that the ill-success of Mary’s
administration was attributable to the control exercised by ecclesiastics
over the public affairs. Under such auspices, the royal power
passed into the hands of a princess who, though by nature leaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
to the Catholic faith and disposed to tread in the footsteps of her
father, was yet placed by the circumstances of her birth in implacable
hostility to Rome, and who held her throne only on the tenure
of waging eternal warfare with reaction. The reformers felt that
the doom of Catholicism was sealed. Emerging from their hiding-places
and hastening back from exile, the religious refugees proceeded
at once to practise the rites of Edward VI. Elizabeth, however,
after ordering some changes in the Roman observances, forbade, on
the 27th of December, all further innovations until the meeting of
Parliament, which was convoked for January 23, 1559.</p>

<p>Parliament assembled on the appointed day and sat until the 8th
of May. It at once passed acts resuming the ecclesiastical crown
lands and restoring the royal supremacy in ecclesiastical matters,
and it repealed all of Mary’s legislation concerning the power of the
papacy. Several other bills were adopted modifying the religion of
the kingdom, with a view of discovering some middle term which
should unite the people in a common form of belief and worship.<a id="FNanchor_1259_1259" href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">1259</a>
Anxious to avoid all extremes, it negatived the measures introduced
by the ardent friends of the Reformation, and among the unsuccessful
attempts was one which proposed to restore all priests who had
been deprived on account of marriage. This, indeed, was laid aside
by the special command of the queen herself.<a id="FNanchor_1260_1260" href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">1260</a></p>

<p>The question of clerical marriage was thus left in a most perplexed
and unsatisfactory condition. The Six Articles had been repealed
by Edward VI., and had been virtually revived by Mary; but Mary’s
efforts had been to restore the independent jurisdiction of the church,
and she had therefore not continued to regard the Six Articles as in
force, the canons of synods and the legatine constitutions of Pole
being the law of her ecclesiastical establishment. This was now
all swept away, a statute to fill the void was refused, and men were
left to draw their own deductions and act at their own peril. Elizabeth
refused the sanction of law to sacerdotal marriage, and would
not restore the deprived priests, yet she did not enforce any prohibitory
regulations, and even promoted many married men. Dr. Parker,
the religious adviser of Ann Boleyn, who had left him in charge of
her daughter’s spiritual education, was married, and one of Elizabeth’s
earliest acts was to nominate him for the vacant primacy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
Canterbury, which after long resistance he was forced to accept.
The uncertainty of the situation and the anxiety of those interested
are well illustrated by a letter to Dr. Parker, dated April 30th, just
before the rising of Parliament, from Dr. Sandys, afterwards Bishop
of Worcester: “The bill is in hand to restore men to their livings;
how it will speed I know not.... Nihil est statutum de conjugio
sacerdotum, sed tanquam relictum in medio. Lever was married
now of late. The queen’s majesty will wink at it, but not stablish
it by law, which is nothing else but to bastard our children.”<a id="FNanchor_1261_1261" href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">1261</a> In
this, Dr. Sandys spoke nothing but truth, and those who were married
were obliged formally to have their children legitimated, as even
Dr. Parker found it necessary to do this in the case of his son
Matthew.<a id="FNanchor_1262_1262" href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">1262</a></p>

<p>At length Elizabeth made up her mind, and in the exercise of her
royal supremacy she asked for no act of Parliament to confirm her
decree. Archbishop Parker has the credit of being the most efficient
agent in overcoming her repugnance to the measure, and the ungracious
manner in which she finally accorded the permission shows how
strong were the prejudices which he had to encounter. In June,
1559, she issued a series of “Injunctions to the Clergy and Laity”
which restored the national religion to nearly the same position as
that adopted by Edward VI., and it is curious to observe that when
she comes to speak of sacerdotal matrimony, she carefully avoids the
responsibility of sanctioning it herself, but assumes that the law of
Edward is still in force. All that she does, therefore, is to surround
it with such limitations and restrictions as shall prevent its abuse,
and although this form had perhaps the advantage of establishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
the legality of all preëxisting marriages, yet the regulations promulgated
were degrading in the highest degree, and the reason
assigned for permitting it could only be regarded as affixing a stigma
on every pastor who confessed the weakness of his flesh by seeking
a wife.<a id="FNanchor_1263_1263" href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">1263</a></p>

<p>From the temper of these regulations it is manifest that if Elizabeth
yielded to the advice of her counsellors and to the pressure of
the times, she did not give up her private convictions or prejudices,
and that she desired to make the marriage of her clergy as unpopular
and disagreeable as possible. It was probably for the purpose of
meeting her objections that the order for a return of the clergy,
issued by Archbishop Parker, October 1st, 1561, contained in the
blanks issued the unusual entry classifying them as married or unmarried,<a id="FNanchor_1264_1264" href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">1264</a>
and Strype informs us that in the Archdeaconry of London
the returns show the ministry for the most part to have been
filled with married men.<a id="FNanchor_1265_1265" href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">1265</a> Even the haughty spirit of the Tudor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
thus, could not restrain the progress which had now fairly set in.
Those around her who controlled the public affairs were all committed
to the Reformation, and were resolved that every point gained should
be made secure. When, therefore, in 1563, there was published a
recension of the Forty-two Articles issued by Edward VI. in 1552,
resulting in the well-known Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of
England, care was taken that the one relating to the liberty of marriage
should be made more emphatic than before. Not content with
the simple proposition of the original that “Bishops, priests, and
deacons are not commanded by God’s law either to vow the estate
of a single life, or to abstain from marriage,” the emphatic corollary
was added, “Therefore it is lawful for them as for all other Christian
men to marry at their own discretion, as they shall judge the same
to serve better to Godliness”<a id="FNanchor_1266_1266" href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">1266</a>—such as we find it preserved to the
present day. This specific declaration in a special article marks the
necessity which was felt to place the matter beyond controversy, as
a rule of practice. The Articles on Justification and Works of
Supererogation (Arts. xi. and xix.) would have sufficed, so far as
principle was concerned.</p>

<p>This was not an empty form. Not only the right to marry at
their own discretion, thus expressly declared, did much to relieve
them from the degrading conditions laid down by the queen, but the
revival and strengthening of the article marked a victory gained over
the reaction. When, in 1559, the queen appointed a commission to
visit all the churches of England and enforce compliance with the
order of things then existing, the articles prepared for its guidance
enjoin no investigation into opinions respecting priestly marriage,
showing that to be an open question, concerning which every man
might hold his private belief.<a id="FNanchor_1267_1267" href="#Footnote_1267_1267" class="fnanchor">1267</a> After the adoption of the Thirty-nine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
Articles, however, this latitude was no longer allowed. In 1567
Archbishop Parker’s articles of instruction for the visitation of that
year enumerate, among the heretical doctrines to be inquired after,
the assertion that the Word of God commands abstinence from marriage
on the part of ministers of the church.<a id="FNanchor_1268_1268" href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">1268</a> As we shall see, it
was about the same time that the council of Trent likewise erected
the question of clerical marriage into a point of belief.</p>

<p>Yet Elizabeth never overcame her repugnance to the marriage of
the clergy, nor is it, perhaps, to be wondered at when we consider
the contempt in which she held the church of which she was the
head,<a id="FNanchor_1269_1269" href="#Footnote_1269_1269" class="fnanchor">1269</a> and her general aversion to sanctioning in others the matrimony
which she was herself always toying with and never contracting.
When she made her favorites of both sexes suffer for any
legalized indiscretions of the kind, it is scarcely surprising that she
always looked with disfavor on those of the clergy who availed themselves
of the privilege which circumstances had extorted from her,
and which she would fain have withheld. When Archbishop Parker
ventured to remonstrate with her on her popish tendencies, she
sharply told him that “she repented of having made any married
bishops.” This was a cutting rejoinder, but even more pointed was
the insolence from which his life-long services could not protect his
wife. The first time the queen visited the archiepiscopal palace, on
her departure she turned to thank Mrs. Parker:—“And you—madam
I may not call you, mistress I am ashamed to call you, so I
know not what to call you—but, howsoever, I thank you.”<a id="FNanchor_1270_1270" href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">1270</a> So in
Ipswich, in August, 1561, she found great fault with the marriage
of the clergy, and especially with the number of wives and children
in cathedrals and colleges—a feeling possibly justified by occasional
disorders not unlikely to occur. In 1563 we find Sir John Bourne
complaining to the Privy Council that the Dean and Chapter of
Worcester had broken up the large organ, the pride of the cathedral,
which had cost £200; the metal pipes whereof were melted into
dishes and divided among the wives of the prebendaries and the case
used to make bedsteads for them; the copes and ornaments, he added,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
would likewise have been distributed had not some of the unmarried
men prevented it, “and as by their Habit and Apparel you might
know the Priests wives, and by their Gate in the Market and the
Streets from an hundred other Women: so in the Congregation and
Cathedral Church they were easy to be known by placing themselves
above all other of the most ancient and honest Calling of the said
City.”<a id="FNanchor_1271_1271" href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">1271</a> There was no lack of persons to pour such stories into the
queen’s ear, and, with her well-known tendencies, it is no wonder
that her counsellors found it difficult to restrain her to the simple
order which she issued from Ipswich, declaring “that no manner of
person, being either the head or member of any college or cathedral
church within this realm, shall, from the time of the notification
hereof in the same college, have, or be permitted to have, within the
precinct of any such college, his wife, or other woman, to abide and
dwell in the same, or to frequent and haunt any lodging within the
same college, upon pain that whosoever shall do to the contrary shall
forfeit all ecclesiastical promotions in any cathedral or collegiate
church within this realm.” Burghley, in sending this royal mandate
to Parker, remarks, “Her Majesty continueth very evil affected
to the state of matrimony in the clergy. And if [I] were not
therein very stiff, her Majesty would openly and utterly condemn
and forbid it. In the end, for her satisfaction, this injunction now
sent to your Grace is devised. The good order thereof shall do no
harm. I have devised to send it in this sort to your Grace for your
province; and to the Archbishop of York for his; so as it shall not
be promulged to be popular.”<a id="FNanchor_1272_1272" href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">1272</a> It is doubtless to this occurrence that
we may attribute the last relic of clerical celibacy enforced among
Protestants, that of the Fellows of the English Universities.</p>

<p>This injunction of Queen Elizabeth caused no little excitement.
Though Burghley had prudently endeavored to prevent its becoming
“popular,” yet Cox, Bishop of Ely, in remonstrating against its
cruelty to those whom it affected in his cathedral seat, shows that it
was speedily known to all men, and that it gave exceeding comfort
to the reactionaries—“What rejoicing and jeering the adversaries
make! How the godly ministers are discouraged, I will pass over.”<a id="FNanchor_1273_1273" href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">1273</a>
In the Universities, where crowds of young men were collected, there
might be some colorable excuse for the regulation, but in the splendid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
and spacious buildings connected with the cathedrals some milder
remedy might easily have been found, and the mandate was particularly
unpalatable to married bishops. Parker himself, who was individually
interested in the matter, made a personal appeal to the
queen, the result of which was to wound him deeply, as well as to
show him how extreme were her prejudices on the subject. He
pours forth his feelings in a letter to Burghley describing the interview—“I
was in an horror to hear such words to come from her
mild nature and Christianly learned conscience, as she spake of
God’s holy ordinance and institution of matrimony. I marvel that
our states in that behalf cannot please her Highness, which we doubt
nothing at all to please God’s sacred Majesty.” He deplores the
effect which it must produce on the people—“We alone of our time
openly brought in hatred, shamed and traduced before the malicious
and ignorant people, as beasts without knowledge to Godward, in
using this liberty of his word, as men of effrenate intemperency,
without discretion or any godly disposition worthy to serve in our
state. Insomuch that the queen’s Highness expressed to me a
repentance that we were thus appointed in office, wishing it had been
otherwise.” The interview had evidently been stormy, and Parker
had been made to feel the full force of Elizabeth’s perverseness—“I
have neither joy of house, land, or name, so abased by my natural
sovereign good lady; for whose service and honor I would not
think it cost to spend my life”—and he even goes so far as to
threaten resistance—“I would be sorry that the clergy should have
cause to show disobedience, with <i>oportet Deo obedire magis quam
hominibus</i>. And what instillers soever there be, there be enough
of this contemned flock, which will not shrink to offer their blood to
the defence of Christ’s verity, if it be either openly impugned or
secretly suggilled.”<a id="FNanchor_1274_1274" href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">1274</a> Evidently, before Parker could have been
driven to such scarcely covered threats, there must have been an
intimation by the angry queen that she would recall the permission
to marry, which, in the existing state of the law, she could readily
have done.</p>

<p>The same spirit which rendered the marriage of a pastor dependent
on the approbation of the neighboring squires caused the retention
of ancient rules, which prove the profound distrust still entertained
as to the discretion and morality of the clergy, and the difficulty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
with which the Anglican church threw off the traditions of Catholicism.
Thus, even in 1571, Grindal, Archbishop of York, promulgates
a modification of the canon of Nicæa, forbidding the residence
with unmarried ministers of women under the age of sixty, except
relatives closely connected by blood.<a id="FNanchor_1275_1275" href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">1275</a> Indeed, in some remote
corners of the kingdom the old license was kept up. Archbishop
Parker, about the year 1565, in speaking of the diocese of Bangor,
states—“I hear that diocese to be much out of order, both having
no preaching there and pensionary concubinary openly continued,
notwithstanding liberty of marriage granted.”<a id="FNanchor_1276_1276" href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">1276</a> It evidently required
time to accustom the clergy to the substitution of the new privileges
for the old.</p>

<p>Although sacerdotal marriage was now fully sanctioned by the
organic canon law of the church, yet it was still exposed to serious
impediments of a worldly character. When thus frowned upon by
her who was in reality, if not in name, Supreme Head of the church;
when the wife of the primate himself could be exposed to such indelible
impertinence; when the marriage of every unfortunate parson was
subjected to degrading conditions, and when it was assumed that his
bride must be a woman at service, the influences affecting the matrimonial
alliances of the clergy must have been of the worst description.
The higher classes of society would naturally model their
opinions on those of the sovereign, while the lower orders had not as
yet shaken off the prejudices in favor of celibacy, implanted in them
by the custom of centuries. Making due allowance for polemical
bitterness, there is therefore no doubt much truth in the sarcastic
account which Sanders gives of the wives of the Elizabethan clergy.
Taking advantage of the refusal of Parliament to formally legalize
such marriages—a refusal which could not but greatly affect the
minds of the people—he assumes that the wives were concubines
and the children illegitimate in the eyes of the law; consequently
decent women refused to undergo the obloquy attached to a union
with a minister of the church, who was therefore forced to take as
his spouse any one who would consent to accept him. The wives of
prelates were ostracized; not received at court, and sharing in no
way the dignities of their husbands, they were kept closely at home
for the mere gratification of animal passion. The members of universities
had been wholly unsuccessful in their efforts to obtain the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
same license, which was only granted to the heads of colleges, under
condition that their wives should reside elsewhere, and should rarely
pollute with their presence the learned precincts.<a id="FNanchor_1277_1277" href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">1277</a></p>

<p>The accuracy of this sarcastic description is confirmed by a statement
made by Percival Wiburn for the benefit of his friends in
Zurich, subsequent to the adoption of the Thirty-nine Articles. He
asserts that “The marriage of priests was counted unlawful in the
times of queen Mary, and was also forbidden by a public statute of
the realm, which is also in force at this day; although by permission
of queen Elizabeth clergymen may have their wives, provided only
they marry by the advice and assent of the bishop and two justices
of the peace, as they call them. The lords bishops are forbidden to
have their wives with them in their palaces; as are also the deans,
canons, presbyters, and other ministers of the church, within colleges,
or the precincts of cathedral churches.”<a id="FNanchor_1278_1278" href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">1278</a> It is not a little curious,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
indeed, to observe that in spite of the formal declaration in the
Thirty-nine Articles, the absence of a special act of Parliament long
caused the question to remain a doubtful one in the public mind.
As late as July, 1566, Lawrence Humphrey and Thomas Sampson,
two zealous Protestants, in denouncing “some straws and chips of
the popish religion” which still defaced the Anglican church, state
that “the marriage of the clergy is not allowed and sanctioned by
the public laws of the kingdom, but their children are by some
persons regarded as illegitimate;” in answer to which, Bishops
Grindal and Horn rejoined that “the wives of the clergy are not
separated from their husbands, and their marriage is esteemed honorable
by all, the papists always excepted.”<a id="FNanchor_1279_1279" href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">1279</a> The matter evidently
was still regarded as a subject of controversy, not yet decided
beyond appeal; and the experience of the previous quarter of a
century had accustomed men to too many vicissitudes for them to
feel safe with so slender a guarantee as the Articles afforded. The
Catholics still constituted a very large proportion of the population,
and they scarcely concealed their feelings towards the innovation.
When Sir John Bourne quarrelled with Dr. Sandys, Bishop of Worcester,
among the formal articles of accusation which he presented to
the Privy Council was the assertion that the Bishop in a sermon
had ridiculed celibacy and had decried the virtue of unmarried
priests.<a id="FNanchor_1280_1280" href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">1280</a> The knight apparently believed that this would be damaging
to the bishop, and the latter seems likewise to have thought so, for
in his answer he emphatically denied it, retorting that his adversary
was a papist who had mass celebrated in his house and who was in
the habit of applying the most opprobrious epithets to the wives of
priests.<a id="FNanchor_1281_1281" href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">1281</a> So when in 1569 the Catholics of the North rose in insurrection
under the Earls of Westmoreland and Northumberland, one
of the grievances of which they complained was the marriage of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
ministers of Christ.<a id="FNanchor_1282_1282" href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">1282</a> During the whole of this transition period the
question was evidently one which occupied largely the public mind,
and in the diversity of opinion it was not easy to see what the ultimate
decision might be. When an irrevocable step such as marriage
was legal only during the pleasure of a capricious woman, whose
assent was known to have been extorted from her, it is no wonder
that it should be looked upon with disfavor by all prudent relatives
of women inclined to venture on it.</p>

<p>Such a state of feeling could not but react most injuriously on the
character of the great body of the clergy. It deprived them of the
respect due to their sacred calling, and consequently reduced them
to the level of such scant respect as was accorded to them. How
long this lasted, and how materially it degraded the ministers of
Christ as a body, cannot be questioned by any one who recalls the
description of the rural clergy in the brilliant third chapter of
Macaulay’s History of England. In 1686 an author complains that
the rector is an object of contempt and ridicule for all above the rank
of the neighboring peasants; that gentle blood would be held polluted
by any connection with the church, and that girls of good
family were taught with equal earnestness not to marry clergymen,
nor to sacrifice their reputation by amourous indiscretions—two misfortunes
which were commonly regarded as equal.<a id="FNanchor_1283_1283" href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">1283</a></p>

<p>Thus eagerly accepted and grudgingly bestowed, the privilege
of marriage established itself in the Church of England by connivance
rather than as a right; and the evil influences of the prejudices
thus fostered were not extinguished for generations.</p>

CALVINISM.</h2>


<p>When John Calvin formulated the system of theology which bears
his name, sacerdotal marriage had already become recognized as one
of the necessary incidents of the revolt against Rome. That the
French Huguenots should accept it accordingly was therefore a
matter of course. Calvin himself manifested his contempt for all
the ancient prejudices by marrying, in 1539, Idelette de Bure, the
widow of the Anabaptist Jean Stordeur, whom he had converted.<a id="FNanchor_1284_1284" href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">1284</a>
The Huguenot Confession of Faith was drawn up by him, and was
adopted by the first national synod, held at Paris in 1559. Of course
the Genevan views of justification swept away all the accumulated
observances of sacerdotalism, and ascetic celibacy shared the fate of
the rest.<a id="FNanchor_1285_1285" href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">1285</a> The discipline of the Calvinist church with regard to
the morality of its ministers was necessarily severe. The peculiar
purity expected of a pastor’s household was shown by the rule which
enjoined any church officer whose wife was convicted of adultery to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>
dismiss her absolutely, under pain of deposition, while laymen, under
such circumstances, were exhorted to be reconciled to their guilty
partners.<a id="FNanchor_1286_1286" href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">1286</a> Any lapse from virtue on the part of a minister was
visited with peremptory deposition;<a id="FNanchor_1287_1287" href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">1287</a> nor was this a mere idle threat
such as were too many of the innumerable decrees of the Catholic
councils quoted above, for the proceedings of various synods show
that it was carried sternly into execution. A list of such vagrant
and deposed ministers was even kept and published to the churches,
with personal descriptions of the individuals, that they might not be
able to impose on the unwary. Indeed, the national synod of Lyons,
in 1563, went so far as to punish those ministers who brought contempt
upon the church by unfitting marriages;<a id="FNanchor_1288_1288" href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">1288</a> and, though this was
omitted from the final code of discipline, it shows the exceeding
strictness with which the internal economy of the ecclesiastical
establishment of the Huguenots was regulated.</p>

<p>The relations of the Catholic church with its apostates were somewhat
confused, and they varied with the political exigencies of the
situation. Ecclesiastics who left the Catholic communion did not
hesitate to enter into matrimony;<a id="FNanchor_1289_1289" href="#Footnote_1289_1289" class="fnanchor">1289</a> and when the desolation of civil
war rendered a forced tolerance of the new religion necessary, their
position was a source of considerable debate, varying with the fluctuations
of the tangled politics of the time. The Edict of Pacification
of Amboise, in March, 1562, was held by the Huguenots to legalize
the marriages of these apostates, but the explanatory declaration of
August, 1563, ordered their reclamation by the church under pain
of exile. When the Spanish alliance gave fresh assurances of triumph
to the Catholics this was enforced with increased severity.
The Edict of Roussillon, in 1564, commands that all priests, monks,
and nuns, who had abandoned their profession and entered into matrimony,
shall sunder their unhallowed bonds and return to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
duties. Recalcitrants were required to leave the kingdom within
two months, under pain, in the case of men, of condemnation to the
galleys for life, and in that of women, of perpetual imprisonment.<a id="FNanchor_1290_1290" href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">1290</a>
As most of the Calvinist ministers necessarily belonged to the class
thus assailed, the effect of this legislation in stimulating the troubles
of the kingdom can readily be perceived.</p>

<p>The dismal strife of the succeeding ten years at length showed
that, in spite of the Tridentine canons, the toleration of this iniquity
was a necessity. Thus in the Edicts of Pacification issued by Henry
III. in 1576 and 1577 there is a provision which admits as valid
the marriages theretofore contracted by all priests or religious persons
of either sex. The issue of such unions was declared competent to
inherit the personalty of the parents and such realty as either parent
might have acquired, but was incapable of other inheritance, direct
or collateral.<a id="FNanchor_1291_1291" href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">1291</a></p>

<p>The church was forced to submit to this temporizing tolerance
of evil, and condescended to entreaty since force was no longer permitted.
In 1581, the council of Rouen, while deploring the number
of monks and nuns who had left their convents, apostatized and
married, directs that they shall be tempted back, treated with kindness,
and pardon be sought for them from the Holy See.<a id="FNanchor_1292_1292" href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">1292</a> In the
final settlement of the religious troubles, the concessions made by
Henry III. were renewed and somewhat amplified by the Edict of
Nantes in 1598.<a id="FNanchor_1293_1293" href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">1293</a> When the reaction came, however, these provisions
were held to be only retrospective in their action, and were
not admitted as legalizing subsequent marriages. Thus in 1628 a
knight of Malta, in 1630 a nun, and in 1640 a priest of Nevers,
who had embraced Calvinism, ventured on matrimony, but were
separated from their spouses and the marriages were pronounced
null.<a id="FNanchor_1294_1294" href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">1294</a> These decisions were based on the principle that the celibacy
of ecclesiastics was prescribed by municipal as well as by canon law,
and that a priest in abjuring his religion did not escape from the
obligations imposed upon him by the laws of the kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_1295_1295" href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">1295</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span></p>

<p>In Scotland, as in France, the question of sacerdotal marriage
may be considered as having virtually been settled in advance. Lollardry
had not been confined to the southern portion of Great
Britain. It had penetrated into Scotland, and had received the
countenance of those whose position and influence were well calculated
to aid in its dissemination among the people. In 1494, thirty
of these heretics, known as “the Lollards of Kyle,” were prosecuted
before James IV. by Robert Blacater, Archbishop of Glasgow. Their
station may be estimated from the fact that they escaped the punishment
due to their sins by the favor of the monarch, “for divers of
them were his great familiars.” The thirty-four articles of accusation
brought against them are mostly Wickliffite in tendency, and their
views on the question of celibacy are manifested in the twenty-second
article which accuses them of asserting “That Priests may have
wives according to the constitution of the Law and of the Primitive
Christian Church.”<a id="FNanchor_1296_1296" href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">1296</a></p>

<p>The soil was thus ready for the plough of the Reformation; while
the temper of the Scottish race gave warrant that when the mighty
movement should reach them, it would be marked by that stern and
uncompromising spirit which alone could satisfy conscientious and
fiery bigots, who would regard all half-measures as pacts with Satan.
Nor was there lacking ample cause to excite in the minds of all men
the desire for a sweeping and effectual reform. Corruption had extended
through every fibre of the Scottish church as foul and as
all-pervading as that which we have traced throughout the rest of
Christendom.</p>

<p>Not long after the year 1530, and before the new heresy had
obtained a foothold, William Arith, a Dominican, ventured to assail
the vices of his fellow churchmen. In a sermon preached at St.
Andrews, with the approbation of the heads of the universities, he
alluded to the false miracles with which the people were deceived,
and the abuses practised at shrines to which credulous devotion was
invited. “As of late dayes,” he proceeded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span> “our Lady of Karsgreng
hath hopped from one green hillock to another: But, honest men of
St. Andrewes, if ye love your wives and daughters, hold them at
home, or else send them in good honest company; for if ye knew
what miracles were wrought there, ye would thank neither God nor
our Lady.” In another sermon, arguing that the disorders of the
clergy should be subjected to the jurisdiction of the civil authorities,
he introduced an anecdote respecting Prior Patrick Hepburn, afterwards
Bishop of Murray. That prelate once, in merry discourse
with his gentlemen, asked of them the number of their mistresses,
and what proportion of the fair dames were married. The first who
answered confessed to five, of whom two were bound in wedlock; the
next boasted of seven, with three married women among them; and
so on until the turn came to Hepburn himself, who, proud of his
<i>bonnes fortunes</i>, declared that although he was the youngest man
there, his mistresses numbered twelve, of whom seven were men’s
wives.<a id="FNanchor_1297_1297" href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">1297</a> Yet Arith was a good Catholic, who, on being driven from
Scotland for his plain speaking, suffered imprisonment in England
under Henry VIII. for maintaining the supremacy of the pope.</p>

<p>How little concealment was thought requisite with regard to these
scandals is exemplified in the case of Alexander Ferrers, which
occurred about the same time. Taken prisoner by the English and
immured for seven years in the Tower of London, he returned home
to find that his wife had been consoled and his substance dissipated
in his absence by a neighboring priest, for the which cause he not
unnaturally “spake more liberally of priests than they could bear.”
By this time, heresy was spreading, and severe measures of repression
were considered necessary. It therefore was not difficult to
have the man’s disrespectful remarks construed as savoring of Lutheranism,
and he was accordingly brought up for trial at St. Andrews.
The first article of accusation read to him was that he despised the
Mass, whereto he answered, “I heare more Masses in eight dayes
than three bishops there sitting say in a yeare.” The next article
accused him of contemning the sacraments. “The priests,” replied
he, “were the most contemnors of the sacraments, especially of matrimony.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>
“And that he witnessed by many of the priests there
present, and named the man’s wife with whom they had meddled,
and especially Sir John Dungwaill, who had seven years together
abused his own wife and consumed his substance, and said: because
I complain of such injuries, I am here summoned and accused as one
that is worthy to be burnt: For God’s sake, said he, will ye take
wives of your own, that I and others whom ye have abused may be
revenged on you.” Old Gawain Dunbar, Bishop of Aberdeen, not
relishing this public accusation, sought to justify himself, exclaiming,
“Carle, thou shalt not know my wife;” but the prisoner turned the
tables on him, “My lord, ye are too old, but by the grace of God I
shall drink with your daughter or I depart.” “And thereat there
was smiling of the best and loud laughter of some, for the bishop had
a daughter married with Andrew Balfour in that town.” The prelates
who sat in judgment found that they were exchanging places
with the accused, and, fearful of further revelations from the reckless
Alexander, commanded him to depart; but he refused, unless each
one should contribute something to replace the goods which his wife’s
paramour had consumed, and finally, to stop his evil tongue, they
paid him and bade him begone.<a id="FNanchor_1298_1298" href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">1298</a></p>

<p>All prelates, however, were not so sensitive. When Cardinal
Beatoun, Archbishop of St. Andrews, primate of Scotland, and
virtual governor of the realm, about the year 1546 married his eldest
daughter to the eldest son of the Earl of Crawford, he caused the
nuptials to be celebrated with regal magnificence, and in the marriage
articles, signed with his own hand, he did not hesitate to call her
“my daughter.” It is not difficult, therefore, to credit the story that
the night before his assassination was passed with his mistress, Marion
Ogilby, who was seen leaving his chamber not long before Norman
Leslie and Kirkaldy of Grange forced their way into his castle.<a id="FNanchor_1299_1299" href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">1299</a> His
successor in the see of St. Andrews, John Hamilton, was equally
notorious for his licentiousness; and men wondered, not at his immorality,
but at his taste in preferring to all his other concubines one
whose only attraction seemed to be the zest given to sin by the fact
that she was the wife of one of his kindred.<a id="FNanchor_1300_1300" href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">1300</a></p>

<p>This is testimony from hostile witnesses, and we might perhaps
impugn their evidence on that ground, were it not that the Catholic
Church of Scotland itself admitted the abandoned morals of its members
when the rapid progress of Calvinism at length drove it in self-defence
to attempt a reform which was its only chance of salvation.
In the last Parliament held by James V. before his death in 1542,
an act was passed exhorting the prelates and ecclesiastics in general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>
to take measures “for reforming of ther lyvis, and for avoyding of
the opin sclander that is gevin to the haill estates throucht the spirituale
mens ungodly and dissolut lyves.”<a id="FNanchor_1301_1301" href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">1301</a> Nothing was then done in
spite of this solemn warning, though the countenance afforded to the
Reformers by the Regent Arran, strengthened by his alliance with
Henry VIII., was daily causing the heresy to assume more dangerous
proportions. When, therefore, the Catholic party, rallying after the
murder of Cardinal Beatoun, at length triumphed with the aid of
France, and sent the young Queen of Scots to marry Francis II.,
they seemed to recognize that they could only maintain their advantage
by meeting public opinion in endeavoring to reform the church.
Accordingly, in November, 1549, a council was convoked at Edinburgh,
of which the first canon declares that the licentiousness of the
clergy had given rise to the gravest scandals, to repress which the
rules enjoined by the council of Bâle must be strictly enforced and
universally obeyed. The second canon is no less significant in ordering
that prelates and other ecclesiastics shall not live with their illegitimate
children, nor provide for them or promote them in the
paternal churches, nor marry their daughters to barons by endowing
them with the patrimony of Christ, nor cause their sons to be made
barons by the same means.<a id="FNanchor_1302_1302" href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">1302</a></p>

<p>This was of small avail. Ten years afterwards, the progress of
heresy becoming ever more alarming, another council was held, in
March, 1559, to devise means to put a stop to the encroachments of
the enemy. To this assembly the Catholic nobles addressed an
earnest prayer for reformation. After alluding to the proceedings
of the Parliament of 1542, they add, “And siclyk remembring in
diverss of the lait provinciale counsales haldin within this realm, that
poynt has been treittet of, and sindrie statutis synodale maid therupon,
of the quhilks nevertheless thar hes folowit nan or litill fruitt
as yitt, bot rathare the said estate is deteriorate ... it is maist
expedient therefore that thai presentlie condescend to seik reformation
of thir lyvis ... and naymlie that oppin and manifest sins and
notor offencis be forborn and abstenit fra in tyme to cum.” In this
request they had been anticipated by the Reformers, who, the previous
year, in a supplication addressed to the queen-regent, included
among their demands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span> “That the wicked, slanderous and detestable
life of Prelats and of the State Ecclesiasticall may be reformed, that
the people by them have not occasion (as of many dayes they have
had) to contemne their Ministrie and the Preaching whereof they
should be Messengers.”</p>

<p>The council, thus urged by friend and foe, recognized the extreme
necessity of the case, and did its best to cure the immedicable disease.
Its first canon reaffirmed the observance of the Basilian regulations,
and appointed a commission empowered to enforce them; and, that
nothing should interfere with its efficiency, the Archbishops of St.
Andrews and Glasgow made a special renunciation of their exemption
from the jurisdiction of the council. The second canon, in forbidding
the residence of illegitimate children with their clerical fathers,
endeavored to procure obedience to the rule ordered by the council of
1549, by permitting it for four days in each quarter, and by a penalty
for infractions of £200 in the case of an archbishop, £100 in that of
a bishop, and leaving the mulct to be imposed on inferior ecclesiastics
at the discretion of the officials. The third canon prohibited the promotion
of children in their father’s benefices, and supplicated the
queen-regent to obtain of the pope that no dispensations should be
granted to evade the rule. The fourth canon inhibited ecclesiastics
from marrying their daughters to barons and lairds, and endowing
them with church lands, or making their sons barons or lairds with
more than £100 annual income, under pain of fine to the amount of
the dowry or lands abstracted from the church; and all grants of
church lands or tithes to concubines or children were pronounced null
and void.<a id="FNanchor_1303_1303" href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">1303</a></p>

<p>When such legislation was necessary, the disorders which it was
intended to repress are acknowledged in terms admitting neither of
palliation nor excuse. The extent of the evil especially alluded to in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
the latter canons is further exemplified by the fact that during the
thirty years immediately following the establishment of the Reformation
in Scotland, more letters of legitimation were taken out than
were issued in the subsequent two centuries. These were given to
the sons of the clergy who were allowed to retain their benefices, and
who then made over the property to their natural children.<a id="FNanchor_1304_1304" href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">1304</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such being the state of morals among the ministers of the old
religion, it is easy to appreciate the immense advantage enjoyed by
the Reformers. They made good use of it. Knox loses no opportunity
of stigmatizing the “pestilent Papists and Masse-mongers” as
“adulterers and whoremasters,” who were thus perpetually held up
to the people for execration, while the individual wrongs from which
so many suffered were noised about and made the subject of constantly-increasing
popular indignation.<a id="FNanchor_1305_1305" href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">1305</a> Yet the abrogation of
celibacy occupies less space in the history of the Scottish Reformation
than in that of any other people who threw off the allegiance to
Rome.</p>

<p>The remote position of Scotland and its comparative barbarism
rendered it in some degree inaccessible to the early doctrines of
Luther and Zwingli. Before it began to show a trace of the new
ideas, clerical marriage had long passed out of the region of disputation
with the Reformers, and was firmly established as one of the
inseparable results of the doctrine of justification professed by all the
reformed churches.<a id="FNanchor_1306_1306" href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">1306</a> Not only was it thus accepted as a matter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
course by all converts to the new faith, but that faith, when once
introduced, spread in Scotland with a rapidity proportioned to the
earnest character of the people. The permission to read the Scriptures
in the vulgar tongue, granted by Parliament in 1543, doubtless
had much to do with this; the leaning of the Regent Arran to the
same side gave it additional impetus, and the savage fierceness with
which the Reformers were prepared to vindicate their belief is shown
by the murder of Cardinal Beatoun, which was countenanced and
justified by Knox himself. Powerful nobles soon saw in it the
means of emancipating themselves from the vacillating control of the
regent; nor was the central authority strengthened when, in 1554,
the reins of power were wrested from the feeble Arran and confided
to the queen-dowager, Mary of Guise, who found herself obliged to
encourage each party by turns, and to balance one against the other,
to prevent either Catholic or Calvinist from obtaining control over
the state. Then, too, as in Germany and England, the temporal
possessions of the church were a powerful temptation to its destruction.
From the great Duke of Chatelleraut to the laird of some
insignificant peel, all were needy and all eager for a share in the
spoil. When, in 1560, an assembly of the nobles at Edinburgh
listened to a disputation on the Mass, and the Catholic doctors were
unable to defend it as a propitiatory sacrifice, the first exclamation of
the lords revealed the secret tendencies of their thoughts—“We have
been miserably deceived heretofore; for if the Mass may not obtain
remission of sins to the quick and to the dead, Wherefore were all
the Abbies so richly doted and endowed with our Temporall lands?”<a id="FNanchor_1307_1307" href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">1307</a></p>

<p>Of course less selfish purposes were put forward to enlist the
support of the people. On the 1st of January, 1559, when the
storm was gathering, but before it had burst, the inmates of the
religious houses found affixed to their gates a proclamation in the
name of “The Blinde, Crooked, Lame, Widows, Orphans, and all
other Poor, so visited by the hand of God as cannot work,” ordering
the monks to leave the patrimony intended to relieve the suffering,
but usurped by indolent shavelings, giving them until Whit-Sunday
to make their exit, after which they would be ejected by force, and
ending with the significant warning—“Let him, therefore, that hath
before stolen, steal no more, but rather let him work with his hands
that he may be helpfull to the poore.”<a id="FNanchor_1308_1308" href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">1308</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span></p>

<p>Such a cry could hardly fail to be popular, but when the threat
was carried into execution, the blind and the crooked, the widow
and orphan received so small a share of the spoil that they were
worse off than before. As we have already seen in England, the
destruction of the Scottish monasteries was the commencement of the
necessity of making some public provision for paupers.<a id="FNanchor_1309_1309" href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">1309</a> The nobles
seized the lion’s share; the rest fell to the crown, subject to the payment
of the very moderate stipends assigned to the comparatively few
ministers required by the new establishment, and these stipends were
so irregularly paid that the unfortunate ministers were frequently in
danger of starvation, and were constantly besieging the court with
their dolorous complaints. Where the lands and revenues went is
indicated with grim humor by Knox, in describing the resistance
offered in 1560 to the adoption of his Book of Discipline by those
who had professed great zeal for the Lord Jesus. Lord Erskine had
been one of the first and most consistent of the “Lords of the Congregation,”
yet he also refused to sign the book—“And no wonder,
for besides that he had a very evill woman to his wife, if the Poore,
the Schooles, and the Ministerie of the Church had their owne, his
Kitchin would lack two parts and more of that which he unjustly
now possesseth.”<a id="FNanchor_1310_1310" href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">1310</a></p>

<p>Yet, when compared with the rich abbatial manors of England or
the princely foundations of Germany, the spoil of the church was
mean indeed. Knox had resided much abroad, and had seen the
vast wealth which the piety of ages had showered upon the church
in the most opulent lands of Europe, yet his simplicity or fanaticism
finds source of wondering comment in the homespun luxury of the
unfortunate monks whom he assisted in dispossessing. When the destruction
of the monasteries in 1559 commenced by a brawl in Perth,
caused by a sermon preached by Knox, and three prominent convents
were broken up, he expatiates on the extravagance revealed to
sight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>—“And in very deed the Grey-Friers was a place so well provided
that unlesse honest men had seen the same, we would have
feared to have reported what provision they had, their sheets, blankets,
beds and coverlets were such that no Earle in Scotland had
better: Their naperie was fine; they were but 8 persons in the Convent,
and yet they had 8 puncheons of salt beef (consider the time
of the yeere, the eleventh of May), wine, beere, and ale, beside store
of victuals belonging thereto.”<a id="FNanchor_1311_1311" href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">1311</a> Imagine an abbot of St. Albans
or an abbess of Poissy reduced to the coverlets and salt beef which
the stern Calvinist deemed an indulgence so great as to be incredible!</p>

<p>Still, in so impoverished a country as the Scotland of that period,
even these poor spoils were a motive sufficient to prove a powerful
aid to the conquering party in the struggle. And yet, amid all the
miserable ambitions of the Erskines and Murrays, the Huntleys and
Bothwells, who occupied the prominent places in the court and camp,
we should do grievous wrong to the spirit which triumphed at last
over the force and fraud of the Guises, if we attributed to temporal
motives alone the movement which expelled licentious prelates and
drove Queen Mary to the fateful refuge of Fotheringay. The selfish
aims of the nobles would have been fruitless but for the zealous
earnestness of the people, led by men of iron nature, who doubted
themselves as little as they doubted their God, and who, in the death-struggle
with Antichrist, were as ready to suffer as they were ruthless
to inflict. Nor can the disorders of the Catholic clergy be rightly
imputed to the temperament of the race, for the Reformers, who carried
with them so large a portion of the middle and lower classes,
preached a system of rigid morality to which the world had been a
stranger since the virtues of the Germanic tribes had been lost in
the overthrow of the Empire; and they not merely preached it, but
obtained its embodiment in a code of repressive laws, which their
vigilant authority strictly enforced.</p>

<p>I have said above that the question of celibacy appears but rarely
in the course of the contest, yet, notwithstanding the causes which
rendered it a less prominent subject of debate than elsewhere, it
occasionally rises to view. The first instance of clerical marriage
that I find recorded occurred in 1538, when Thomas Coklaw, parish
priest of Tillibodie, married a widow of the same village named
Margaret Jameson. This, however, was not done openly and defiantly,
as in Germany, but in secret, and the married couple con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>tinued
to dwell apart. That the infraction of the canons was not
without danger was shown by the result, for, when it became known,
Coklaw was tried by the Bishop of Dumblane and condemned to perpetual
imprisonment; but his relatives broke open his dungeon and
he escaped to England. When, early in the following year, a group
of reformers, including Dean Thomas Forret, Friar John Killore,
Friar John Beverege, and others, were put on trial, their presence
at this wedding was one of the crimes for which they were executed
upon Castle Hill at Edinburgh.<a id="FNanchor_1312_1312" href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">1312</a> In fact, the abrogation of the rule
of celibacy, in Scotland as elsewhere, was necessarily one of the
leading points at issue between the Reformers and the Catholics.
Thus, when George Wishart, one of the early heretics who ventured
openly to preach the Lord Jesus, was seized, in spite of powerful
protectors, and after a prolonged captivity was brought for trial before
Cardinal Beatoun in 1545, in the accusation against him article 14th
asserted, “Thou false Hereticke hast taught plainly against the Vows
of Monks, Friers, Nuns, and Priests, saying, That whosoever was
bound to such like Vows, they vowed themselves to the state of damnation.
Moreover, That it was lawfull for Priests to marry wives
and not to live sole.” Wishart tacitly confessed the truth of this
impeachment by rejoining—“But as many as have not the gift of
chastity, nor yet for the Gospel have overcome the concupiscence of
the flesh, and have vowed chastity; ye have experience, although I
should hold my tongue, to what inconveniences they have exposed
themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_1313_1313" href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">1313</a> He was accordingly condemned as an incorrigible
heretic, and promptly burnt. Yet when, in 1547, John Knox held
his disputation with Dean Wynrame and Friar Arbuckle, though
the nine articles drawn up for discussion ranged from the supremacy
of the pope and the existence of purgatory to the payment of tithes,
the subject of vows of chastity was not even mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_1314_1314" href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">1314</a></p>

<p>Still, even as late as 1558 the trial of Walter Mill shows that the
question was even yet agitated in the controversies between the
polemics of the two parties. Mill had been a priest and had married,
and the first of the articles of accusation against him was that
he asserted the lawfulness of sacerdotal marriage. To this he boldly
assented, declaring that he regarded matrimony as a blessed bond,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>
open for all men to enter, find that it were better for priests to marry
than to vow chastity and not preserve it, as they were wont to do.
Condemned to the stake, the unfortunate old man commanded the
sympathies of the people, even in the archiepiscopal town of St.
Andrews. No one could be found to act as executioner, until at
length one of the servants of the archbishop consented to fill the
abhorrent office; but when a rope was sought with which to bind
the wretched sufferer to the stake, no one would furnish it, and the
tragedy was necessarily postponed. Equally unsuccessful was the
next day’s search, until the archbishop, fearing to lose his victim,
gave the cords of his own pavilion, and the sentence was carried into
effect. Even after the sacrifice, the popular feeling was manifested
raising a pile of stones as a monument on the place of torture,
and as often as these were cast aside by the priests they were replaced
by the people, until the followers of the archbishop carried them off
by night, and used them for building.<a id="FNanchor_1315_1315" href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">1315</a></p>

<p>These incidents show us that the question received its share of
attention in the controversy by which each side endeavored to secure
the support of the nation, but it makes no appearance in public
negotiations and declarations. Thus, in 1558, when the growing
strength of the Lords of the Congregation led the Catholics to offer
concessions, which were rejected by the conscious power of the Reformers,
there was no allusion to celibacy on either side. In fact,
between the respective leaders, the questions were almost purely
personal and political; while among the conscientiously religious
supporters of either party, opinions were too rigidly defined for argument.
Convictions were too divergent and too firm for compromise
or concession to be possible, and Catholic and Calvinist grimly
recognized, as by a tacit understanding, the alternative of extermination.
When the English alliance at last drove the Catholics to the
wall, and in July, 1560, there assembled the parliament to which by
the Articles of Leith was referred the duty of effecting a settlement
of the kingdom, the vanquished party made no struggle against their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
fate. Such Catholic prelates and lords as took their seats refrained
from all debate, and allowed the victors to arrange the temporal and
spiritual affairs of the kingdom at their pleasure.</p>

<p>In this settlement, our subject affords a curious comparison between
the English and Scotch churches. In the former, at a period even
later than this, it was considered necessary to embody a renunciation
of celibacy in the organic law, which has been maintained to the
present day. In the latter, ecclesiastical marriage had become
already so firmly established in the minds of the Reformers that it
was accepted as a matter of course, which needed no special confirmation.
Although laws were passed prohibiting the Mass and
abolishing the supremacy of the pope, none were thought necessary
to legalize the marriages of the clergy. Even in Knox’s Confession
of Faith, adopted by the parliament on the 17th of July, there is no
direct allusion to the matter. The only passage which can be construed
as having any bearing upon it occurs in Chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span>, when
considering “What works are reputed good before God”—“And
evill works we affirme not onely those that are expressly done against
God’s commandment, but those also that in matters of religion and
worshipping of God have no assurance, but the invention and opinion
of man, which God from the beginning hath ever rejected, as by the
prophet Isaiah and by our Master Christ Jesus we are taught in
these words—<i>In vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines which
are precepts of Men.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_1316_1316" href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">1316</a></p>

<p>Nothing more, in fact, was needed when the triumph of the new
ideas was so complete that Knox could exultingly exclaim, “For
what Adulterer, what Fornicator, what known Masse-monger or
pestilent Papist durst have been seen in publike within any Reformed
Town within this Realme before that the Queen arrived?... For
while the Papists were so confounded that none within the Realme
durst avow the hearing or saying of Masse then the thieves of Tiddisdale
durst avow their stouth or stealing in the presence of any
upright judge.”<a id="FNanchor_1317_1317" href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">1317</a> When persecution thus had changed sides, no
minister could feel that his nuptials required special authorization.
How thoroughly, indeed, they were legitimated is shown by a curious
little incident occurring in 1563. A minister named Baron
made complaint to the General Assembly that his wife, an English
woman named Anne Goodacre,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span> “after great rebellions by her committed,”
had left him and taken refuge in England, whereupon he
requested the Assembly to have her brought back to him. Spotswood,
the Superintendent of Lothian, with Knox and Craig, actually
wrote to Archbishop Parker officially asking him to have the woman
sought for and sent to Scotland; but Parker, considering it to be an
international question and beyond his sphere, prudently referred the
request to Secretary Cecil.<a id="FNanchor_1318_1318" href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">1318</a></p>

<p>It were foreign to our object to enter into the dark details of
Mary’s short and disastrous reign. The intrigues of the camarilla,
the boyish weakness of Darnley, the subtlety of Rizzio, and the
coarse ambition of Huntley and Bothwell, were alike harmless against
the earnest reverence of the people for the new faith; and the expiring
struggles of Catholicism were too feeble to give any practical
importance to the vain attempts at reaction.</p>

<h2><a name="XXVIII" id="XXVIII">XXVIII.</a><br />

THE COUNCIL OF TRENT.</h2>


<p>It has already been observed that the dissolute and unchristian
life of the priesthood was one of the efficient causes which led to the
success of the Reformation. At an early period in the movement,
the Catholic church felt the necessity of purifying itself, if it was to
retain the veneration of the people; and the veneration of the people
was now not merely a source of revenue, but a condition of the very
existence of the stupendous structure reared upon the credulity of
ages. As soon as it became clearly apparent that Lutheranism was
not to be suppressed by the ordinary machinery, and that it was
spreading with a rapidity which portended the worst results, an
effort was made to remove the reproach which incorrigible immorality
had entailed upon the church. Allusion has been made above
to the stringent measures of reform proclaimed by the legate Campeggi
at Ratisbon, in 1524, in which he acknowledged that the new
heresy had no little excuse in the detestable morals and abandoned
lives of the clergy—a truth repeatedly admitted by the ecclesiastical
authorities.<a id="FNanchor_1319_1319" href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">1319</a> His well-meant endeavors had little result, and we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span>
seen that, some years later, Erasmus still urged the abolition of the
rule of celibacy as the only practicable mode of removing the scandal.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards the Gallican church made a strenuous effort
of the same nature to check the spread of Lutheranism. In 1521,
before it had to encounter a hostile heresy, the council of Paris had
deplored the pervading corruptions with exceeding candor. The
condition of conventual discipline was such as to threaten the very
existence of the system, and the customary denunciations of ineradicable
abuses were freely published.<a id="FNanchor_1320_1320" href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">1320</a> In 1528 the Cardinal-legate
Duprat, Chancellor of France, held a council in Paris, where he condemned,
seriatim, the new doctrines as heresies, and elevated the rule
of celibacy to the dignity of a point of faith.<a id="FNanchor_1321_1321" href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">1321</a> He also caused the
adoption of a series of canons designed to remove from the church
the disgrace caused by the laxity of clerical morals and manners.
The bishops were instructed to enforce the decrees of the councils
and of the fathers until concubinage and incontinence should be completely
exterminated, and a rule was laid down which would have
been eventually effectual if conscientiously carried out. No one was
thereafter to be admitted to holy orders without written testimony as
to his age and moral character from his parish priest, substantiated
by the oaths of two or three approved witnesses.<a id="FNanchor_1322_1322" href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">1322</a> At the same time
similar councils were held at Bourges by the Cardinal Archbishop
Tournon, and at Lyons by Claude, Bishop of Macon. To what
extent these excellent rules were put in force may be guessed by a
description of the French clergy in 1560, as portrayed by Monluc,
Bishop of Valence, in a speech before the royal council. The parish
priests were for the most part engrossed in worldly pursuits, and had
obtained their preferment by illicit means, nor did there seem much
prospect of an improvement so long as the prelates were in the habit
of bestowing the benefices within their gift on their lackeys, barbers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
cooks, and other serving men, rendering the ecclesiastics as a body
an object of contempt to the people.<a id="FNanchor_1323_1323" href="#Footnote_1323_1323" class="fnanchor">1323</a> We need, therefore, not be
surprised to find in the councils of the period a repetition of all the
old injunctions, showing that the maintenance of improper consorts
and the disgrace of priestly families were undiminished evils.<a id="FNanchor_1324_1324" href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">1324</a> This
description of the French clergy is most emphatically extended to
the whole church in the project for reformation drawn up by order
of Paul III. in 1538, and to these evils are attributed the innumerable
scandals which afflicted the faithful, as well as the contempt
in which the ecclesiastical body was held and the virtual extinction
of all reverence for the services of religion.<a id="FNanchor_1325_1325" href="#Footnote_1325_1325" class="fnanchor">1325</a></p>

<p>In 1530 Clement VII. addressed himself vigorously to the task
of putting an end to the scandalous practice of hereditary transmission
of benefices, which he describes as almost universal. A special
Bull was issued, prohibiting the children of priests or monks from
enjoying any preferment in their father’s benefices, and, recognizing
that the Roman curia was one of the chief obstacles to all reform, he
provided that if he or his successors should grant dispensations permitting
such infraction of the canons, they should be considered as
issued unwittingly, and be held null and void.<a id="FNanchor_1326_1326" href="#Footnote_1326_1326" class="fnanchor">1326</a> Like so many others,
this Bull seems to have been forgotten almost as soon as issued, and
the pecuniary needs of the Roman court rendered it unable to abandon
so lucrative a source of revenue. Even as soon as 1538 the cardinals
to whom Paul III. committed the task of drawing up the project of
reformation cautiously intimate that they hear of such dispensations
being granted, and to this they attribute a large share of the troubles
of the church and the enmity felt towards the Holy See.<a id="FNanchor_1327_1327" href="#Footnote_1327_1327" class="fnanchor">1327</a> This
warning passed unheeded, and, as we have seen, in 1559 a Scottish
council prayed the queen-regent to use her influence with the pope to
prevent dispensations being granted to enable illegitimate children
to hold preferment in their father’s benefices,<a id="FNanchor_1328_1328" href="#Footnote_1328_1328" class="fnanchor">1328</a> while in 1562 the fre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span>quency
and readiness with which such dispensations were still obtained
are enumerated in a list of abuses laid before the council of Trent by
Sebastian King, of Portugal, as one of the matters requiring reformation
by the supreme power of the council.<a id="FNanchor_1329_1329" href="#Footnote_1329_1329" class="fnanchor">1329</a> To this and other
similar appeals the papal legates loftily replied that laws were not to
be prescribed to the Holy See;<a id="FNanchor_1330_1330" href="#Footnote_1330_1330" class="fnanchor">1330</a> and the motive for the refusal is
easily comprehended when we see that in the “Taxes of the Penitentiary”
the price for a dispensation admitting the bastard of a
priest to holy orders was a ducat and a carlino.<a id="FNanchor_1331_1331" href="#Footnote_1331_1331" class="fnanchor">1331</a></p>

<p>In Spain, the most dangerous opponent of the Reformation, Ignatius
Loyola, succeeded to some extent in repressing the public and
unblushing manifestation of concubinage. His biographer states that
the female companions of the Peninsular clergy were accustomed to
pledge their faith to their consorts, as if united by the marriage-tie,
and that they wore the distinguishing costume of married women,
as though glorying in their shame.<a id="FNanchor_1332_1332" href="#Footnote_1332_1332" class="fnanchor">1332</a> Scandalized by this, on his
return to his native land, in 1535, Ignatius exerted himself to abolish
it, together with other priestly peccadilloes, and his influence was
sufficient to procure the enactment and enforcement by the temporal
authorities of sundry laws which relieved the Spanish church from
so great an opprobrium.<a id="FNanchor_1333_1333" href="#Footnote_1333_1333" class="fnanchor">1333</a> Yet, though this semi-authorized cohabitation
may have been checked, the custom of notorious concubinage
continued to flourish. Bernardino Diaz de Luco, a Spanish jurist,
not long afterwards, deplores the frequency of the vice, but warns
judges that they should not be over-severe in repressing it, since so
few are found guiltless, and there is danger that those who are
restrained from it may be forced into darker sins.<a id="FNanchor_1334_1334" href="#Footnote_1334_1334" class="fnanchor">1334</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span></p>

<p>About the same time, Hermann von Wied, Archbishop of Cologne,
undertook the reformation of his extensive diocese. He assembled a
council which issued a series of 275 canons, prescribing minutely the
functions, duties, and obligations of all grades of the clergy. As
regards the delicate subject of concubinage, he contented himself
with quoting the Nicene canon prohibiting the residence of women
not nearly connected by blood, and added that if the degeneracy of
the times prevented the enforcement of a regulation so strict, at all
events he forbade the companionship of females obnoxious to suspicion.<a id="FNanchor_1335_1335" href="#Footnote_1335_1335" class="fnanchor">1335</a>
The good bishop himself could hardly have expected that
so mild an allocution would have much effect upon a perverse and
hardened generation.</p>

<p>In 1537, Matthew, Archbishop of Salzburg, assembled his provincial
synod, which, recognizing the urgent necessity of preserving
the church and protecting the people, adopted a series of reformatory
canons. Apparently afraid of promulgating them, however, it was
resolved to suppress them for the present under the pretext that the
approaching general council would regulate the discipline of the
church at large, and the archbishop contented himself with a pastoral
letter addressed to his suffragans, in which he urged upon them to
consider the contamination to which the laity were exposed through
the vices of their pastors, and timidly suggested that, if the clergy
could not restrain their passions, they should at all events indulge
them secretly, so that scandal might be avoided and the punishment
of their transgressions be left to an avenging God.<a id="FNanchor_1336_1336" href="#Footnote_1336_1336" class="fnanchor">1336</a></p>

<p>Even in the council of Trent itself, the Bishop of St. Mark, in
opening its proceedings with a speech, January 6th, 1546, drew a
fearful picture of the corruption of the world, which had reached a
degree that posterity might possibly equal but not exceed. This he
assured the assembled fathers was attributable solely to the wickedness
of the pastors, who drew their flocks with them into the abyss
of sin. The Lutheran heresy had been provoked by their own guilt,
and its suppression was only to be hoped for by their own reformation.<a id="FNanchor_1337_1337" href="#Footnote_1337_1337" class="fnanchor">1337</a>
At a later session, the Bavarian orator, August Baumgartner,
told the assembled fathers that the progress of the Reformation was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span>
attributable to the scandalous lives of the clergy, whose excesses he
could not describe without offending the chaste ears of his auditory.
He even asserted that out of a hundred priests there were not more
than three or four who were not either married or concubinarians<a id="FNanchor_1338_1338" href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">1338</a>—a
statement repeated in a consultation on the subject of ecclesiastical
reform drawn up in 1562 by order of the Emperor Ferdinand, with
the addition that the clergy would rather see the whole structure of
the church destroyed than submit to even the most moderate measure
of reform.<a id="FNanchor_1339_1339" href="#Footnote_1339_1339" class="fnanchor">1339</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is not to be wondered therefore that the Christian world had
long and earnestly demanded the convocation of an œcumenic council
which should represent all parties, should have full powers to reconcile
all differences, and should give to the ancient church the purification
thus recognized as the only efficient means of healing the
schism. This was a remedy to the last degree distasteful to the Holy
See. The recollections of Constance and Bâle were full of pregnant
warnings as to the almost inevitable antagonism between the Vicegerent
of Christ and an independent representative body, believing
itself to act under the direct inspiration of the Holy Ghost, claiming
autocratic supremacy in the church, and convoked for the special
purpose of reforming abuses, the most of which were fruitful sources
of revenue to the papal court. Such a body, if assembled in Germany,
would be the pope’s master; if in Italy, his tool; and it
behooved him to act warily if he desired to meet the unanimous
demand of Christendom without risking the sacrifice of his most
cherished prerogatives. Had the council been called in the early
days of the Reformation, it could hardly have prevented the separation
of the churches; yet, in the temper which then existed, it would
probably have effected as thorough a purification of the ecclesiastical
establishment as was possible in so corrupt an age. By delaying it
until the reactionary movement had fairly set in, the chances of
troublesome puritans gaining the ascendency were greatly diminished,
and the papal court exposed itself to little danger when, under the
urgent pressure of the emperor, it at length, in 1536, proposed to
convoke the long desired assembly at Mantua.<a id="FNanchor_1340_1340" href="#Footnote_1340_1340" class="fnanchor">1340</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span></p>

<p>A place so completely under papal influence was not likely to
meet the views of the opposition, and it is not surprising that both
the Lutherans and Henry VIII. refused to connect themselves with
such a council. The latter, indeed, in his epistle of April 8, 1538,
to Charles V., expressed himself more forcibly than elegantly:—“Nowe,
if he [the pope] calle us to one of his owne townes, we be
afraid to be at suche an hostes table. We saye, Better to ryse a
hungred, then to goo thense with oure bellyes fulle.”<a id="FNanchor_1341_1341" href="#Footnote_1341_1341" class="fnanchor">1341</a> The formality
of its opening, May 17th, 1537, was therefore an empty ceremony;
its transfer to Vicenza was little more; and, as no delegates presented
themselves up to the 1st of May, 1538, it was prorogued until
Easter, 1539, with the promise of selecting a satisfactory place for
the meeting. The pressure still continued until, in May, 1542,
Paul finally convoked it to assemble at Trent. The Reformers were
no better satisfied than before. They had so long professed their
readiness to submit all the questions in dispute to a free and unbiased
general council, that they could not refuse absolutely to countenance
it; but they were now so completely established as a separate organization,
that they had little to hope and everything to fear from the
appeal which they had themselves provoked, and nothing which Rome
could now offer would have brought them into willing attendance
upon such a body.<a id="FNanchor_1342_1342" href="#Footnote_1342_1342" class="fnanchor">1342</a> They accordingly kept aloof, and on the assembling
of the council, November 22d, 1542, its numbers were so scanty
that it could accomplish nothing, and it was accordingly suspended
in July, 1543. When again convoked, March 15th, 1545, but twenty
bishops and a few ambassadors were present; these waited with
what patience they might command for accessions, which were so
tardy in arriving that when at length the assembly was formally
opened, on the 13th of December, the number had increased by only
five. For fifteen months the council continued its sessions, completely
under the control of the pope, and occupied solely with measures
designed to draw the line between the Catholic and the Reformed
churches more sharply than ever.</p>

<p>The appeals of the German bishops and of the imperial ambass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>adors
for some effective efforts at reform became at length too
pressing, and to evade them, in March, 1547, the council was transferred
to Bologna, against the earnest protest of the emperor and
the Spaniards, who refused to follow.<a id="FNanchor_1343_1343" href="#Footnote_1343_1343" class="fnanchor">1343</a> At Bologna little was done
except to dispute over the sharp protests of the emperor and to adjourn
the council from time to time, until, after falling into universal
contempt, it was suspended in 1549. Julius III., who received the
tiara on the 22d of February, 1550, signalized his accession by convoking
it again at Trent; and there it once more assembled on the
1st of May, 1551.</p>

<p>At that time Lutheranism in Germany was under the heel of
Charles V.; Maurice of Saxony was ripening his schemes of revolt,
and concealing them with the dexterity in which he was unrivalled;
it was the policy of both that Protestant theologians should take part
in the discussions—of the one, that they should there receive their
sentence; of the other, that their presence might assist in cloaking
his designs. The flight from Innspruck, followed by the Transaction
of Passau, changed the face of affairs. The Lutheran doctors rejoicingly
shook the dust from their feet as they departed from Trent,
complaining that they had been treated as criminals on trial, not as
venerable members of a body assembled to decide the gravest questions
relating to this life and that to come. Other symptoms of
revolt among the Catholic nations were visible, and on the 28th of
April, 1552, the council again broke up.<a id="FNanchor_1344_1344" href="#Footnote_1344_1344" class="fnanchor">1344</a></p>

<p>Ten years passed away; the faithful impatiently demanded the
continuation of the work which had only been commenced, and at
last the pressure became so strong that Pius IV. was obliged to reassemble
the council.<a id="FNanchor_1345_1345" href="#Footnote_1345_1345" class="fnanchor">1345</a> His Bull bears date November, 1560, but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>
was not until twenty years after Trent had witnessed the first convocation
that the holy men again gathered within its walls, and on
the 18th of January, 1562, the council resumed its oft-interrupted
sessions. The States of the Augsburg Confession had been politely
invited to participate in the proceedings, but they declined with the
scantest of courtesy.<a id="FNanchor_1346_1346" href="#Footnote_1346_1346" class="fnanchor">1346</a></p>

<p>During this long-protracted farce there were times when those who
sincerely desired the restoration of the church could not restrain their
impatience. In 1536, Paul III., who earnestly admitted the necessity
of some reform, called to his aid nine of his prelates most
eminent for virtue and piety, as a commission to prepare a scheme
for internal reformation.<a id="FNanchor_1347_1347" href="#Footnote_1347_1347" class="fnanchor">1347</a> According to a papal historian, his object
in this was to stop the mouths of the heretics who found in the
Roman court an inexhaustible subject of declamation.<a id="FNanchor_1348_1348" href="#Footnote_1348_1348" class="fnanchor">1348</a> For two
years the commission labored at its work, and finally produced the
“Consilium de emendanda ecclesia,” to which allusion has been made
above.</p>

<p>The stern and unbending Cardinal Caraffa was head of the commission,
assisted by such men as Contarini, Sadoleto, and Reginald
Pole. They seem to have been inspired with a sincere desire to root
out the chief abuses which gave such power to the assaults of the
Protestants, and the result of their labors affords us a picture of
ecclesiastical corruptions almost as damaging to the church as the
complaints of the Diet of Nürnburg. As regards celibacy, they
were disposed to make no concession; indeed, they protest against
the facility with which men in holy orders were able to purchase
from the Roman curia dispensations to marry. It is significant,
however, that they had so little confidence in the possibility of purifying
the religious orders that they actually recommended the aboli<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>tion
of the whole monastic system. To prevent individual cases of
suffering they proposed that the convents should not be immediately
abolished, but that all novices should be discharged and no more be
admitted, thus allowing the orders to die out gradually, as had been
done in Saxony; and meanwhile they urged that, to prevent further
scandals, all nunneries should be removed from the supervision and
direction of monks.<a id="FNanchor_1349_1349" href="#Footnote_1349_1349" class="fnanchor">1349</a> The “Consilium,” in fact, was so candid a
confession of most of the abuses charged upon the church by the reformers
that Luther forthwith translated it and published it with a
commentary, as an effective pamphlet in aid of his cause. Caraffa
himself, after he had attained the papacy, under the name of Paul
IV., quietly put his own work, in 1559, into the Index Expurgatorius.<a id="FNanchor_1350_1350" href="#Footnote_1350_1350" class="fnanchor">1350</a></p>

<p>The changes recommended in the “Consilium” attacked too many
vested interests for Paul III., however earnest himself, to be able
to give it effect. The project therefore was dropped and only resulted
in rendering still more clamorous the call for a reform in the
head and members of the church. As, moreover, it had shown the
powerlessness of the papacy to overcome acknowledged abuses, the
only hope of a radical change, such as was needful, was seen to lie
in the untrammelled debates of a great assembly, which should meet
as a parliament of the nations; and the prospect of this grew more
and more distant. While the project of transferring the council
from Trent was being matured, it occurred to the papal court that
possibly the objections to that measure and the pressure on the
council for a thorough reformation might be averted by showing a
disposition on the part of Rome to undertake the task of cleansing
the Augean stable. It was also recognized as an important gain
if the council could be confined to the harmless task of defining
questions of faith, while the substantial powers involved in reforming
the corruptions of the church could be claimed and exercised by the
Pope. Accordingly Pius III. drew up an elaborate Bull designed
to limit some of the more flagrant pecuniary abuses which existed,
and exhorting the bishops to correct the morals of their subordinates.
This was sent to the legates at Trent, but they and their confidants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
unanimously agreed that, in the existing temper of the council, the
promulgation of such a document would be in the highest degree
imprudent. It was accordingly suppressed, and has only seen the
light within the present century.<a id="FNanchor_1351_1351" href="#Footnote_1351_1351" class="fnanchor">1351</a> In its failure the church lost
but little, for it touched the evils of the time with a tender and hesitating
hand, and would have proved utterly inefficacious.</p>

<p>At length, when shortly afterwards the unmannerly urgency of the
Germans, clamoring for decided measures of reform, was met by the
translation of the council to Bologna in 1547, and men despaired of
further results from it, Charles V. resolved to take the matter into
his own hands, and to effect, for his own dominions at least, that
which had been vainly expected of the council for Christendom.
The “Interim,” which has already been alluded to, was intended to
answer this purpose as far as Lutheranism was concerned, in healing
the breach of religion. The other great object of the council, the
restoration of the neglected discipline of the church, he attempted
to effect by means of the secular authority of the empire acting on
the regular machinery of the Teutonic ecclesiastical establishment.
How utterly neglected that discipline had become is inferable from
an expression in the important and carefully drawn project which
had been laid by Charles before the Diet of Ratisbon in 1541, to
the effect that if the canon requiring celibacy was to be enforced, it
would be necessary also to revive those canons which punished incontinence,
thus admitting that there existed no check whatever upon
immorality.<a id="FNanchor_1352_1352" href="#Footnote_1352_1352" class="fnanchor">1352</a></p>

<p>To accomplish this desirable revival of discipline he accordingly
caused the adoption by the Diet of Augsburg of a code of reformation,
well adapted, if enforced, to restore the long-forgotten purity
of the church, while at the same time it acknowledged that the degeneracy
of the times rendered impossible the resuscitation of the
ancient canons in their strictness. Thus, after reciting the canon of
Neocæsarea (see p. 51), it adds, that as such severity was now impracticable,
those in holy orders convicted of impurity should be
separated from their concubines, and visited with suspension from
function and benefice proportioned to the gravity of the offence. A
repetition of the fault was punishable with increased severity, and
incorrigible sinners who were found to be incapable of reformation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span>
were finally to be deprived of their benefices. As concubines were
threatened with immediate excommunication, it is evident that a
severity was designed towards them which was not ventured on with
respect to their more guilty partners. Relaxation of the rules is
also observable in the section which, despite the Nicene canon, permitted
the residence of women over forty years of age, whose character
and conduct relieved them from suspicion.<a id="FNanchor_1353_1353" href="#Footnote_1353_1353" class="fnanchor">1353</a> The imperative
injunctions of chastity laid upon the regular clergy, canons, and
nuns, show not only the determination to remove the prevailing
scandals, but also the magnitude and extent of the evil.<a id="FNanchor_1354_1354" href="#Footnote_1354_1354" class="fnanchor">1354</a></p>

<p>Nor was this all. Local councils were ordered for the purpose of
embodying these decrees in their statutes, and of carrying out with
energy the reformation so earnestly desired. Thus, in November,
1548, about five months after the Diet, a synod assembled at Augsburg,
which inveighed bitterly against the unclerical dress and pomp
of the clergy, their habits of drunkenness, gluttony, licentiousness,
tavern-lounging, and general disregard of discipline; and adopted a
canon embracing the regulations enacted by the emperor.<a id="FNanchor_1355_1355" href="#Footnote_1355_1355" class="fnanchor">1355</a> The
Archbishop of Trèves did not wait for his synod, but issued, October
30th, a mandate especially directed against concubinary priests, in
which he announced his intention of carrying out the reform commanded
by Charles. He could find no reason more self-evident for
the dislike and contempt felt by the people for so many of the clergy
than the immorality of their lives, differing little, except in legality,
from open marriage. “This vice, existing everywhere throughout
our diocese, in consequence of the license of the times and the
neglect of the officials, we must eradicate. Therefore all of you,
of what grade soever, shall dismiss your concubines within nine days,
removing them beyond the bounds of your parishes, and be no longer
seen to associate with loose and wanton women. Those who neglect
this order shall be suspended from office and benefice, their concubines
shall be excommunicated, and they themselves be brought
before our synod to be presently held.”<a id="FNanchor_1356_1356" href="#Footnote_1356_1356" class="fnanchor">1356</a></p>

<p>These were brave words, but when, some three weeks later, the
synod was assembled, and the malefactors perchance brought before
it, the good bishop found apparently that his flock was not disposed
to submit quietly to the curtailment of privileges which had almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>
become imprescriptible. His tone accordingly was softened, for
though he deprecated their immorality more strongly than ever, and
asserted his intention of enforcing his mandate, he condescended to
argue at much length on the propriety of chastity, and even descended
to entreaty, beseeching them to preserve the purity so essential
to the character of the church, the absence of which had drawn
upon the clergy an odium which could scarce be described in words.<a id="FNanchor_1357_1357" href="#Footnote_1357_1357" class="fnanchor">1357</a>
How slender was his success may be inferred from the fact that the
next year he felt it necessary to hold another synod, in which he
renewed and confirmed the proceedings of the former one, and endeavored
to reduce the monks and nuns of his diocese into some
kind of subjection to the rules of discipline.<a id="FNanchor_1358_1358" href="#Footnote_1358_1358" class="fnanchor">1358</a></p>

<p>The Archbishop of Cologne was as energetic as his brother of
Trèves, with about equal success. On September 1st he issued the
Augsburg Formula of Reformation, with a call for a synod to be
held on October 2d. At the same time he manifested his sense of
the primary importance of correcting clerical immorality by promulgating
a special mandate respecting concubinage. He asserted this
to be the chief cause of the contempt popularly felt for the church,<a id="FNanchor_1359_1359" href="#Footnote_1359_1359" class="fnanchor">1359</a>
and he ordered all ecclesiastics to send their women beyond the bounds
of their parishes within nine days, under the penalties provided in
the imperial decree. The synod was held at the time indicated, and,
though it adopted no regular canons, it accepted the Augsburg Formula
and the mandate of the archbishop, with a trifling alteration.<a id="FNanchor_1360_1360" href="#Footnote_1360_1360" class="fnanchor">1360</a></p>

<p>This proved utterly ineffectual, for in March, 1549, he assembled
a provincial council, in which he deplored the license of the times,
which rendered the strictness of the ancient canons unadvisable, and
he announced that it had been decided to proceed gradually with the
intended reforms. As to the morals of the clergy, he stated that
everywhere the cure of souls was delegated to improper persons,
many of them living in the foulness of concubinage, in perpetual
drunkenness, and in other infamous vices, encouraged by the negligence
of bishops and the thirst of archdeacons for unhallowed gains.
The unions of those who, infected by the new heresies, did not hesitate
to enter into matrimony, were of course pronounced illicit and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span>
impious, their offspring illegitimate, and the parents anathematized;
but for those who remained in the church, yet submitted to no restraint
upon their passions, a more merciful spirit was shown, for the
punishments ordered by the Diet of Augsburg were somewhat lightened
in their favor. The extreme license of the period may be
understood from another canon directed against the comedians, who,
not content with the ordinary theatres, were in the habit of visiting
the nunneries, where their profane plays and amatory acting excited
to unholy desires the virgins dedicated to God.<a id="FNanchor_1361_1361" href="#Footnote_1361_1361" class="fnanchor">1361</a> No one acquainted
with the coarseness of the drama of that rude age can doubt the propriety
of the archbishop’s reproof. Supplementary synods were also
held in October, 1549, and February, 1550, to perfect the details of
a very thorough inquisitorial visitation of the whole province.</p>

<p>This visitation, so pompously heralded, did not take place. At a
synod held in October, 1550, the archbishop made sundry lame
excuses for its postponement. Another synod was assembled in
February, 1551, at which we hear nothing more of it; but the prelates
of the diocese were requested to collect such ancient and forgotten
canons as they could find, which might be deemed advantageous
in the future;<a id="FNanchor_1362_1362" href="#Footnote_1362_1362" class="fnanchor">1362</a> and with this the work of reformation in the
province of Cologne appears to end.</p>

<p>In 1549, Ernest, Archbishop of Salzburg, assembled the synod of
his extensive province, but when his clergy understood that it was
intended to confirm the reformatory edict of the emperor, they had
the audacity to present a petition praying that the clause ordering
the removal of their concubines should not be enforced. They declared
that the attempt to do so would be attended with serious difficulty,
and that it would lead to greater evils than it sought to remove,
and they asked that the consideration of the matter should be referred
to the general council, whose reassembling was no longer dreaded.
The synod, with a proper sense of its dignity, refused to receive the
shameless petition, and listened rather to those of its members who
complained of the practice of the officials in receiving bribes for permitting
illicit indulgences, and the representations of Duke William,
of Bavaria, who asserted that the Lutheran heresy had been caused
by the scandalous corruption of the church. A canon was accord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span>ingly
adopted which renewed the regulations of Bâle and ordered
the speedy removal of all recognized and notorious concubines.<a id="FNanchor_1363_1363" href="#Footnote_1363_1363" class="fnanchor">1363</a></p>

<p>In October and November, 1548, and April, 1549, the Bishops
of Paderborn, Wurzburg, and Strassburg held synods which adopted
the reformatory measures decreed at Augsburg.<a id="FNanchor_1364_1364" href="#Footnote_1364_1364" class="fnanchor">1364</a> These were preparatory
to the metropolitan synod of Mainz, assembled in May,
1549, which commanded that no one should be thereafter admitted
to orders without a preliminary examination by his bishop on the
subject of doctrine, and testimonials from the people as to purity of
character. After thus wisely providing for the future, attention was
directed to the present. It was declared intolerable that, in spite of
the reiterated prohibitions of the fathers and councils, concubines
should be universally kept; the Basilian canon was therefore revived,
and its enforcement strictly enjoined on the ordinaries, who were
forbidden in any manner to connive at these disorders for the sake
of profit.<a id="FNanchor_1365_1365" href="#Footnote_1365_1365" class="fnanchor">1365</a></p>

<p>The pressure was continued, for when Cambrai, which owed temporal
obedience to the emperor, while ecclesiastically it formed part
of the province of Rheims, neglected to adopt the Formula of Augsburg
for two years, it was not allowed to escape. In October, 1550,
a synod was finally assembled there under stringent orders from
Charles, and the Formula was published, together with an elaborate
series of canons, which would have been well adapted to correct
abuses that were not incorrigible.<a id="FNanchor_1366_1366" href="#Footnote_1366_1366" class="fnanchor">1366</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Charles had thus exerted all the resources of his imperial supremacy,
and, whether willingly or not, the powerful prelates who ruled
the German church had united in carrying out his views. The temporal
and spiritual authorities had thus been concentrated upon the
vices of the church, and if its reformation had been possible, in the
existing condition of its organization, some improvement must have
resulted from these combined and persistent efforts. How nugatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span>
were the results may be guessed from a memorial presented in 1558,
by the University of Louvain, to Philip II., exhorting him to grant
no toleration to the heretics, but, at the same time, urging upon him
the absolute necessity of some comprehensive system of reform to
purify the church, all the orders of which were given over utterly to
the twin vices of avarice and licentiousness.<a id="FNanchor_1367_1367" href="#Footnote_1367_1367" class="fnanchor">1367</a> The same testimony
is borne by a consultation drawn up in 1562 by order of the Emperor
Ferdinand. After alluding to the efforts at reform made by
Paul III. and Charles V., it declares that their only result has been
to make the condition of clerical morality worse than before, exciting
the hatred of the people for their priests to an incredible pitch, and
doing more to inflame the ardor of heresy than all the teaching of
Christian truth can do to restrain it.<a id="FNanchor_1368_1368" href="#Footnote_1368_1368" class="fnanchor">1368</a></p>

<p>As the failure of all efforts to improve clerical morality under the
existing rules of discipline was thus found to be complete, there arose
in the minds of thinking men a conviction, such as Erasmus had
already declared, that, since all other measures had proved fruitless,
the only mode of securing a virtuous clergy was to remove the prohibition
of marriage. At the Polish Diet of 1552 petitions praying
for sacerdotal matrimony were presented, and, though they failed in
their object, the Diet of 1556 authorized King Sigismund Augustus
to address Paul IV. with a request, in the name of the nation, to
grant it as well as communion in both elements.<a id="FNanchor_1369_1369" href="#Footnote_1369_1369" class="fnanchor">1369</a></p>

<p>The dissension thus existing within the church is exhibited in a
volume published in 1558 by Stanislas Hosius, Bishop of Ermeland,
earnestly arguing against communion in both elements, clerical marriage,
and the use of the vulgar tongue in worship. As regards
celibacy, he assumes that it had been maintained unbrokenly for
fifteen hundred years, and was not now to be abandoned to gratify
a few disorderly monks. The example of the Greek church he meets
by pointing out that the Greeks were suffered to be persecuted by
the Turks; the argument that marriage would purify the church he
silences with the observation that many married men are adulterers;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span>
and he holds it to be a doubting of God to suppose that the gift of
continence would be denied to those who properly seek it.<a id="FNanchor_1370_1370" href="#Footnote_1370_1370" class="fnanchor">1370</a> In spite
of the logic of polemics such as Hosius, the opinions of the innovators
continued to gain ground, until at length they won even the
highest dignitaries of the empire, and in 1560 the Emperor Ferdinand
himself undertook their advocacy with the pope, after having
for some years countenanced the practice within his own territories.</p>

<p>Almost immediately on the consecration of Pius IV., in addressing
to him an argument for the reassembling of the council of Trent, or
the convocation of a new council, Ferdinand seized the opportunity
to ask especially for the communication of the cup to the laity, and
permission for the clergy to marry. The latter of these points he
considered to be the only remedy for the fearful immorality of the
church, for, though all flesh was corrupt, the corruption of the priesthood
surpassed that of all other men.<a id="FNanchor_1371_1371" href="#Footnote_1371_1371" class="fnanchor">1371</a> That he had not waited for
the papal assent to favor these innovations within his own dominions
is shown by his statement that the Archbishop of Salzburg had
recently, in a synod, earnestly called upon him to put a stop to the
progress which they were making, but, he added, his long experience
in such matters had shown him what was possible, and what impossible,
and he had accordingly set forth the difficulties of the task in
a paper addressed to the archbishop, a copy of which he inclosed to
the pope.<a id="FNanchor_1372_1372" href="#Footnote_1372_1372" class="fnanchor">1372</a></p>

<p>The nuncio Commendone, in transmitting this document to Rome,
accompanied it with a letter from the Cardinal Bishop of Augsburg,
recommending the postponement of the question until the reassem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span>bling
of the council of Trent, and, as Pius answered it in this sense,
no further action was taken, though Ferdinand made haste to repeat
his demand, in view of the impatience of both clergy and people, who
could ill brook the delays inseparable from the discussion of the subject
in so unwieldy a body.<a id="FNanchor_1373_1373" href="#Footnote_1373_1373" class="fnanchor">1373</a> When Commendone, moreover, passed
through Cleves on his way to the council, then about to be reopened,
the Duke of Cleves earnestly besought him to lend his influence to
the accomplishment of the measure, urging as a reason that in the
whole of his dominions—and he was sovereign of three populous
duchies—there could not be found five priests who did not keep concubines.
In order to secure his favor for the approaching council,
Commendone did not scruple to hold out expectations that the concessions
would be granted.<a id="FNanchor_1374_1374" href="#Footnote_1374_1374" class="fnanchor">1374</a></p>

<p>During the progress of the Reformation, when the fate of the
Catholic church of Germany had sometimes seemed to hang in the
balance, no princes had earned a larger title to the gratitude of Rome
than the powerful Dukes of Bavaria, who were the leaders of the
reaction. Yet now the influence of that important region was thrown
in favor of the abrogation of celibacy, and Duke Albert was the first
who boldly brought the matter before the council by a demand for
ecclesiastical marriage, presented on the 27th of June, 1562. To
this the evasive answer was returned that the council would take
such action as would be found to redound to the glory of God and
to the benefit of the church.<a id="FNanchor_1375_1375" href="#Footnote_1375_1375" class="fnanchor">1375</a> During the same year the Emperor
Ferdinand also repeatedly urged its consideration. A plan for the
reform of the church presented by his delegates not only called
attention to the necessity of purifying the morals of the regular and
secular clergy, but demanded that, to some nations at least, the privilege
of sacerdotal marriage should be conceded.<a id="FNanchor_1376_1376" href="#Footnote_1376_1376" class="fnanchor">1376</a> Another elaborate
paper argued the question with much temperate force, and declared
that many priests had already married for the purpose of escaping
the corruptions of celibacy, while studiously preserving themselves
from the errors of Lutheranism. Out of a hundred parish priests
scarcely one could be found who was not either openly or secretly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>
married, and it was necessary to tolerate them to prevent the utter
destruction of the church.<a id="FNanchor_1377_1377" href="#Footnote_1377_1377" class="fnanchor">1377</a></p>

<p>A third document is extant, without date, which was laid before
the cardinals of the papal court by the emperor, in which the question
was argued at considerable length and with much vehemence.
After asserting that from the records of the primitive church celibacy
was not then recognized as imperative, it proceeded to declare that
if marriage ever were permissible, the present carnal and licentious
age rendered it a necessity, for not one Catholic priest out of fifty
could be found who lived chastely. All were asserted to be notoriously
dissolute, scandalizing the people and inflicting great damage
on the church. The request was made not so much to satisfy the
priests who desired marriage as to meet the wishes of the laity, for
many patrons of livings refused presentation to all but married men.
However preferable a single life might be for the clergy, it therefore
was thought better to give it up than to leave open the door to the
scandalous impurities traceable to celibacy. Another weighty reason
was alleged in the great scarcity of priests, caused alone by the prohibition
of marriage, in proof of which it was urged that the Catholic
schools of divinity were all but empty and the episcopal function of
ordination nearly disused, while the Lutheran colleges were crowded
by those who subsequently obtained admission into the true church,
where they worked incredible mischief. The argument that the
temporal possessions of the church would be imperilled by sacerdotal
matrimony was met by indignantly denouncing the worldly wisdom
which would protect such perishable interests at the cost of innumerable
souls sacrificed by the existing condition of affairs. For these
and other reasons it asked that marriage should in future be allowed
to all the priesthood, whether already in orders or to be subsequently
admitted: that married men of good character and education should
be ordained to supply the want of pastors: that those who had contracted
matrimony, in contravention of the canons, should no longer
be ejected, seeing that it was most absurd to turn out men because
they were married, while retaining notorious concubinarians, and
that if, with equal justice, both classes should be dismissed, the people
would be left almost, if not entirely, destitute of spiritual guides.
The paper concluded by asserting that if the prayer be granted the
clergy could be retained in the church and in the faith, to the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span>
benefit of their flocks, and that the scandal of promiscuous licentiousness,
which had involved the church in so much disgrace, would
be removed.<a id="FNanchor_1378_1378" href="#Footnote_1378_1378" class="fnanchor">1378</a></p>

<p>This vivid sketch of the condition of the church, with the evils
which were everywhere felt, and the remedies which suggested themselves
to clear-sighted and impartial men, was as ineffectual as other
similar efforts had been, for to all such arguments the council of Trent
was deaf. France, too, was more than willing to see celibacy abolished.
M. de Lanssac, the French ambassador, was ordered to place
himself in close relations with the representatives of the emperor,
and to unite with them in seeking the relaxation of all regulations
which tended to prevent the reunion of the Protestants, while the
Gallican bishops were commanded to show themselves reasonable and
yielding in such matters; and when Lanssac reported the demands
of the emperor, comprehending clerical marriage among other changes,
Charles IX. assented to them in terms of warm commendation.<a id="FNanchor_1379_1379" href="#Footnote_1379_1379" class="fnanchor">1379</a> The
Cardinal of Lorraine, moreover, was instructed to urge some measures
efficient to reform the licentious lives of the ecclesiastics which spread
corruption and debauchery among the people, while permission for
priestly marriage was recommended as one of the means essential to
recall the heretics to the bosom of the true church.<a id="FNanchor_1380_1380" href="#Footnote_1380_1380" class="fnanchor">1380</a> As a compromise,
however, the French prelates contented themselves with suggesting
that none but elderly men should be eligible to the priesthood,
and that the testimony of the people in favor of their moral character
should be a prerequisite to ordination, in hopes that by such means
the necessary purification of the clergy at least could be effected,
while the sharpest measures should be adopted to punish their licentiousness.<a id="FNanchor_1381_1381" href="#Footnote_1381_1381" class="fnanchor">1381</a></p>

<p>All this was useless, and, in fact, it is difficult to imagine how any
one could expect a reform of this nature from a body composed of
prelates all whom were obliged by Pius IV., in a decree of September
4th, 1560, to solemnly swear to a profession of faith containing
a specific declaration that the vows of chastity assumed on entering
into holy orders or monastic life were to be strictly observed and
enforced.<a id="FNanchor_1382_1382" href="#Footnote_1382_1382" class="fnanchor">1382</a> The question thus was prejudged, and the council was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>
more likely to listen to Bartholomew a Martyribus, the Archbishop
of Bracara, who laid before them a paper containing the points which,
in his opinion, required reformation, among which were the revival
of the canons respecting concubinary bishops and priests, the prohibition
of sons succeeding to their father’s benefices, and the excommunication
of confessors who debauched their fair penitents<a id="FNanchor_1383_1383" href="#Footnote_1383_1383" class="fnanchor">1383</a>—though
when the sturdy archbishop in a stormy debate declared that “illustrissimi
cardinales egent illustrissima reformatione,” he doubtless was
held to be a most uncourtly and impracticable reformer.</p>

<p>Despite all the urgency from without, it was not until the 8th of
February, 1563, after the council had been in session for more than
a year, that the theologians at last arranged for disputation the articles
on matrimony, and laid them before the council for discussion. They
were divided into five classes, of which the fourth was devoted to the
bearing of the subject on the clergy, consisting of two propositions
artfully drawn up to justify rejection, while preserving the appearance
of presenting the subject for deliberation.—That matrimony
was preferable to celibacy, and that God bestowed grace on the married
rather than on the single.—That the priests of the Western
Church could lawfully contract marriage, notwithstanding the canons;
that to deny this was to condemn matrimony, and that all were at
liberty to marry who did not feel themselves graced with the gift of
chastity.<a id="FNanchor_1384_1384" href="#Footnote_1384_1384" class="fnanchor">1384</a></p>

<p>The disputation on the various questions connected with matrimony
commenced the next day, and was continued at intervals for
six months. By August 7th all the canons on the subject were
agreed to, except the one on clandestine marriages, which gave the
fathers much more trouble than the more important decision respecting
the retention of celibacy.<a id="FNanchor_1385_1385" href="#Footnote_1385_1385" class="fnanchor">1385</a> This latter, indeed, was a foregone
conclusion. In the minute account, transmitted from day to day by
Archbishop Calini to Cardinal Cornaro, in which all the details of
internal discussion and external intrigue attainable by a quick-witted
member of the council were reported, there is no allusion to the subject.
No debates or diversity of opinion are mentioned, no intima<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span>tion
that the matter was regarded as open to a doubt, and even the
appeals made by the emperor and other potentates are passed over
in silence, for the very sufficient reason that the papal legates, who
controlled all the business of the council, refused to allow them to
be read.<a id="FNanchor_1386_1386" href="#Footnote_1386_1386" class="fnanchor">1386</a> In their reply to the emperor’s remonstrances, indeed,
they declared that to have such a subject publicly broached in the
council would create a fearful scandal throughout Christendom, and
Pius IV. approved of their answer as the best that could be given.<a id="FNanchor_1387_1387" href="#Footnote_1387_1387" class="fnanchor">1387</a>
It is no wonder, therefore, that in the correspondence of the nuncio
Visconti the only allusion to the matter is a simple reference, under
date of March 22, 1563, to the demand previously made by the
Duke of Bavaria.<a id="FNanchor_1388_1388" href="#Footnote_1388_1388" class="fnanchor">1388</a></p>

<p>In fact, when, on March 4th, the 5th and 6th articles were reached,
they were both unanimously pronounced heretical without any prolonged
debate. Doctor Juan de Ludegna pronounced a “disputation”
on the subject, the tone of which showed that the result was
already decided, and that the only disposition of the council was to
vilify those who desired the abrogation of celibacy.<a id="FNanchor_1389_1389" href="#Footnote_1389_1389" class="fnanchor">1389</a> A discussion,
however, then arose as to the power of the pope to dispense the
clergy, both regular and secular, from the obligation of celibacy, and
on this point there was considerable diversity of opinion, occupying
numerous successive meetings in its settlement. The majority were
in favor of the papal power; and its exercise in the existing condition
of the church was even recommended by those who recognized
the evils of the system, but shrank from the responsibility of themselves
introducing the innovation. This was promptly rebuked by
the conservatives, according to Fra Paolo, with the remark that a
prudent physician would not attempt to cure one disease by bringing
on a greater.<a id="FNanchor_1390_1390" href="#Footnote_1390_1390" class="fnanchor">1390</a> The legates, indeed, were blamed for allowing any
discussion on so dangerous a topic, since, if priests were permitted to
marry, their affections would be concentrated on family and country,
in place of the church; their subjection to the Holy See would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span>
diminished, the whole system of the hierarchy destroyed, and the
pope himself would eventually become a simple Bishop of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_1391_1391" href="#Footnote_1391_1391" class="fnanchor">1391</a>
If such consequences as these were anticipated by the able men who
represented the papal interests, we may readily believe that Pallavicini
speaks the sense of the managers of the council when he
remarks, concerning the princes who exerted themselves in favor of
sacerdotal marriage, that they seemed to consider that the council
had been convoked for the purpose not of condemning but of contenting
the heretics, whom they proposed to convert by gratifying
in place of repressing their contumacious desires.<a id="FNanchor_1392_1392" href="#Footnote_1392_1392" class="fnanchor">1392</a> If this be so, the
Protestants were amply justified in refusing to submit their cause to a
body so different in its objects from that free and unbiased œcumenic
council to which they had so often appealed from their persecutors.</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding that the policy of the church was thus immutable,
there seems to have been no hesitation in holding out fallacious
hopes to the expectant populations. When, in the spring of
1563, the Bavarians, wearied with endless promises, rose in revolt
and demanded the use of the cup and priestly marriage, their duke
was obliged to make a promise to his Diet that if the required concessions
were not granted in June, by either the council or the pope,
he would himself give the desired permission. The threatened defection
of this Catholic stronghold caused such alarm that the legates at
Trent forthwith despatched Niccolo Ormanetto to the duke, to persuade
him to withdraw his promised reforms under a pledge that the
council would take such order as would satisfy the demands of his
people.<a id="FNanchor_1393_1393" href="#Footnote_1393_1393" class="fnanchor">1393</a></p>

<p>These promises were soon forgotten, though it was not until the
11th of November that the canons on matrimony were finally adopted
and formally published. Of these there are two relating to our subject.
The first one pronounced the dread anathema on all who should
dare to assert that clerks in holy orders, monks, or nuns could contract
marriage, or that such a marriage was valid, since God would
not deny the gift of chastity to those who rightly sought it, nor would
He expose us to temptation beyond our strength. The other similarly
anathematized all who dared to assert that the married state was
more worthy than virginity, or that it was not better to live in celibacy
than married.<a id="FNanchor_1394_1394" href="#Footnote_1394_1394" class="fnanchor">1394</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span></p>

<p>Thus the church, in endeavoring to meet the novel exigencies
caused by the progress and enlightenment of mankind, in place of
making the concessions demanded by almost all beyond the narrow
pale of the papal court, devoted its energies to the miserable task of
separating itself as widely as possible from those who had left it.<a id="FNanchor_1395_1395" href="#Footnote_1395_1395" class="fnanchor">1395</a>
Its rulers seemed to imagine that their only hope of safety lay in
intrenching themselves behind the exaggerations of those particular
points of policy which had afforded to their adversaries the fairest
chances of attack. The faithful throughout Germany might suffer
from the absence of the ministers of Christ, or might endure yet
more from the unrestrained passions of the wolves in sheep’s clothing
let loose among their wives and daughters, but the church militant
in this conjuncture dreaded even more to lose the aid of that monastic
army which, in theory at least, had no earthly object but the service
of St. Peter; it selfishly feared that the parish priest who might
legitimately see his fireside surrounded by a happy group of wife
and children would lose the devotion which a man without ties should
entertain for the prosperity and glory of the ecclesiastical establishment;
and perhaps, more than all, it saw with terror avaricious
princes eager for the secularization of that immense property to
which it owed so large a portion of the splendor which dazzled mankind,
of the influence which rendered it powerful, and of the luxury
which made its high places attractive to the ambitious and able men
who controlled its destiny. To put an end, therefore, at once and
forever, to the mutterings of dissatisfaction among those who compared
the calm and virtuous life of the Protestant pastors with the
reckless self-indulgence of the ministers of the old religion, it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>
resolved to place the canon of celibacy in a position where none of
the orthodox should dare to attack it, and to accomplish this the
simple rule of discipline was elevated to the dignity of a point of
belief. As the church had already been forced, in defending the
rule from the assaults of the reformers, to attribute to it apostolic
origin, we may not perhaps be surprised that it was made a point
of doctrine, but we cannot easily appreciate the reasons that would
justify the anathema launched against all who regarded the marriage
of those in holy orders as binding. The dissolution of such marriages,
as we have seen, was not suggested until the middle of the
twelfth century, and the decision of the council thus condemned as
heretics the whole body of the church during three-quarters of its
previous existence.</p>

<p>Although the doctrinal canon threw the responsibility of priestly
unchastity upon God, yet as the council had so peremptorily refused
to adopt the remedy urged by the princes of the empire, it did not
hesitate to employ human means to remove, if possible, the scandals
which God had permitted to afflict the church. The decree of reformation,
published in December, 1563, contained provisions intended
to curb the vice which the Tridentine fathers, with all their reliance
on Divine power, well knew to be ineradicable. These provisions,
however, were little more than a repetition of what we have seen
enacted in every century since Siricius. Any ecclesiastic guilty of
keeping a concubine, or woman liable to suspicion, was admonished;
disregarding this first warning, he was deprived of one-third of his
revenue; if still contumacious, suspension from functions and benefice
followed; and a persistence in guilt was then visited with irrevocable
deprivation. No appeal from a sentence could gain exemption;
these cases were removed from the jurisdiction of inferior officials and
confided to the bishops, who were enjoined to be prompt and severe
in their decisions; while guilty bishops were liable to suspension by
their provincial synods, and, if irreclaimable, were sent to Rome for
punishment. The illegitimate children of priests were pronounced
incapable of preferment. Those already in orders, if employed in
their fathers’ parishes, were required, under pain of deprivation, to
exchange their positions within three months for preferment elsewhere,
and any provision made by a clerical parent for the benefit of
his children was pronounced to be a fraud.<a id="FNanchor_1396_1396" href="#Footnote_1396_1396" class="fnanchor">1396</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span></p>

<p>Such were the regulations which this great general council of the
Catholic church considered sufficient to relieve the establishment of
the curse which had hung around it for a thousand years. There is
nothing in them that had not been tried a hundred times before, with
what success the foregoing pages may attest. In some respects,
indeed, they were not as prompt and efficacious as the decrees which
Charles V. and his bishops had promulgated a few years previous,
and which had proved so lamentably inefficient. There were not
wanting enlightened members of the council who bitterly felt the
inefficiency of what they were doing, but the undignified haste of the
closing sessions, and the all-powerful opposition of Rome, rendered
them unable to accomplish more. As the Bishop of Astorga said in
a letter to Granvelle—“They are not as we would have wished, to
correct the abuses and scandals of the church, which cause so many
to fall into error, but we have to do what we are permitted to do, not
what we would wish to do.”<a id="FNanchor_1397_1397" href="#Footnote_1397_1397" class="fnanchor">1397</a> Heretics, indeed, who asserted that there
was in reality no intention of suppressing concubinage, could point
in justification to the curious fact that, while previous councils had
provided heavy penalties against the concubines of priests, that of
Trent passed them over as though they were guiltless.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Strange as it may seem, the anathema so decidedly enunciated by
the council did not deter Albert of Bavaria and the Emperor Ferdinand
from continuing their efforts to procure for their subjects the
benefit of a relaxation of the canon. The decision of a majority of
the doctors of the council favoring the papal power of dispensation
suggested the mode of obtaining it. Although the form of the canons
had been adopted on the 7th of August, and the previous proceedings
left no doubt as to their authoritative promulgation in full session,
yet, on the 26th of August, the nuncio Visconti writes that he had
heard from his colleague Delfino, then in Vienna, that the three
ecclesiastical electors (Mainz, Trèves, and Cologne), the Archbishop
of Salzburg and the Duke of Bavaria had held a conference, in which
it was resolved to unite with the emperor in an appeal for Bulls permitting
the marriage of the clergy and the use of the cup by the
laity.<a id="FNanchor_1398_1398" href="#Footnote_1398_1398" class="fnanchor">1398</a> Early in September the emperor wrote to his ambassadors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span>
stating that he had called together at Vienna the deputies of the
electors and princes of the empire, where, after mature deliberation,
it had been determined to ask the cup and clerical marriage of the
pope and not of the council; that a protocol had already been drawn
up, which accompanied the despatch, but as it was a matter not yet
fully settled, he desired it to be communicated to no one but the
Count de Luna, the ambassador of Philip II.<a id="FNanchor_1399_1399" href="#Footnote_1399_1399" class="fnanchor">1399</a></p>

<p>It was not, however, until February, 1564, after the conclusion of
the council, which brought its weary labors to an end on the 4th of
December, 1563, that Ferdinand and Albert presented their requests
to Pius IV. The two papers were essentially the same. In the
name of the princes of the empire, after demanding the communion
in both elements for the laity, they proceeded to argue earnestly for
the other concession. Perhaps the decided opposition of the council
to the principle of sacerdotal marriage had produced an influence
upon them; perhaps they had found themselves obliged to yield some
of their own views in order to secure the coöperation of the Teutonic
hierarchy; be this as it may, their demands were greatly abated. In
place of asking, as before, the privilege for the clergy at large, they
now reduced their entreaties to the simple request of allowing such
Catholic priests as had entered into matrimony, to retain their wives
and perform their functions, which they assured the pope was absolutely
essential to the preservation of the fragments of the church
still doing battle with the prevailing heresies throughout Germany.<a id="FNanchor_1400_1400" href="#Footnote_1400_1400" class="fnanchor">1400</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span>
They likewise asked that in such places as could not obtain a sufficiency
of pastors, the bishops should be empowered to ordain married
laymen of approved piety, learning, and fitness.</p>

<p>These appeals were successful as far as communion in both elements
was concerned, for, on April 16th, Pius granted that concession under
certain conditions. The subject of priestly marriage, however, he
still postponed, and on June 17th we find Ferdinand writing to
Cardinal Morone, to express his thanks for what he had obtained,
and to urge the other subject on the consideration of the papal
court. He had instructed his ambassador, he said, to press it
earnestly, and he besought the Cardinal to aid in so pious and
advantageous a work.<a id="FNanchor_1401_1401" href="#Footnote_1401_1401" class="fnanchor">1401</a></p>

<p>Nor was this the only means which Ferdinand, then verging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span>
rapidly to the grave, adopted to attain the object of his unwearied
pursuit. George Wicelius had thrown aside the monastic gown in
1531, to embrace the errors of Lutheranism, but had returned to the
old religion. His learning and piety earned for him a deserved reputation,
and elevated him to the position of imperial councillor, where
his talents were devoted to the endless task of bringing about a
reconciliation between the churches. George Cassander, equally
eminent, had never incurred the imputation of apostasy, but had
labored with tireless industry to convert his erring brethren from
heresy to the true faith. Men like these might perhaps be heard
when the voice of princes and prelates, actuated by motives of personal
advantage, met a deaf ear; and Ferdinand applied to them for
disquisitions on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_1402_1402" href="#Footnote_1402_1402" class="fnanchor">1402</a> Before their labors were concluded
the monarch was dead (July 25, 1564), but his son Maximilian II.
inherited his father’s ideas, and gladly made use of the opinions
which the learned Catholic doctors had no hesitation in expressing.</p>

<p>Both took strong ground against celibacy. Cassander, while
defending the church for originally introducing the rule, deplored
the terrible and abominable scandals which its untimely enforcement
caused throughout the church, and he urged that the reasons which
had led to its introduction not only existed no longer, but had even
become arguments for its abrogation, since now the choice lay only
between married priests and concubinarians. He declared it to be
the source of numerous evils, chief among which was promiscuous
and unbridled licentiousness, and he added that the already scanty
ranks of the priesthood were deprived of the accessions which were
so necessary, since men of a religious turn of mind were prevented
from taking orders by the universal wickedness which prevailed
under the excuse of celibacy, while pious parents kept their sons
from entering the church for fear of debauching their morals. On
the other hand, those who sought a life of ease and license were
attracted to the holy calling which they disgraced. He was even
willing to permit marriage in orders, arguing that it was only a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span>
question of canon law, in which faith and doctrine were not involved.
As regards the monastic orders, while fully appreciating the principles
upon which the system was founded, he warmly deplored the
corruption engendered by wealth and luxury. Though the convents
contained many pious and holy men, still for the most part religion
was forgotten in the observance of ceremonies that had lost their
significance, and nothing could be more licentious and profane than
the life led in many of the monasteries.<a id="FNanchor_1403_1403" href="#Footnote_1403_1403" class="fnanchor">1403</a> Wicelius was equally severe
in his denunciations of the clerical licentiousness attributable to the
rule of celibacy, and concluded his tract by attacking the supineness,
blindness, and perversity of the prelates who suffered such foulness
to exist everywhere among the priesthood, in contempt of Christ,
and to the burdening of their consciences.<a id="FNanchor_1404_1404" href="#Footnote_1404_1404" class="fnanchor">1404</a></p>

<p>It was already evident that both the great objects for which the
council of Trent had ostensibly been assembled were failures; that
it would effect as little for the purification of the church as for the
reconciliation of the heretics. Perhaps Maximilian felt that under
these circumstances no one could deny the necessity of such changes
as would at least afford a chance of the reformation that could no
longer be expected of the Tridentine canons; perhaps he felt strengthened
by the support of his ecclesiastical counsellors and controversialists;
perhaps, with the zealous hopefulness of youth, he felt a
confidence of which age and many disappointments had deprived
his father; or perhaps he was encouraged by the concession to his
subjects and to those of Albert of Bavaria, of the communion in
both elements, not knowing that in two short years it would be
withdrawn. Certain it is that in a negotiation with the Bishop of
Vintimiglia, papal nuncio at his court, he lost no time in renewing,
with increased energy, the effort to obtain the recognition of married
priests. After the departure of the nuncio, he addressed, in November,
1564, a most pressing demand to Pius IV., in which he
declared that the matter brooked no further postponement; that
throughout Germany, and especially in his dominions, there was the
greatest need of proper ministers and pastors; that there was no
other measure which would retain them in the Catholic church, from
which, day by day, they were withdrawing, principally from this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span>
cause. He assured the Holy Father that the danger was constantly
increasing, and that he feared a further delay would render even this
remedy powerless to prevent the total destruction of the old religion.
If only this were granted to the clergy, even as the cup had been
communicated to the laity, he hoped for an immediate improvement.
The bishops could then exercise their authority over those who at
present were beyond their control, as unrecognized by the church;
and so thoroughly was this lawless condition of affairs understood
that a refuge was sought in his provinces by those disreputable
pastors who were banished from the Lutheran states on account of
their disorderly lives.<a id="FNanchor_1405_1405" href="#Footnote_1405_1405" class="fnanchor">1405</a> His brother, the Archduke Charles, was
equally urgent, in a letter which he addressed, a few days later, to
the Pope, repeating the same arguments, and assuring him that the
only hope for the true religion in his dominions was to find some
means of admitting the services of a married clergy.<a id="FNanchor_1406_1406" href="#Footnote_1406_1406" class="fnanchor">1406</a></p>

<p>Ferdinand and Maximilian were actuated in these persevering
efforts not merely by the desire of gratifying the wishes of their
people, or of remedying the depravity of the ecclesiastical body. It
had been a favorite project with the father, warmly adopted by the
son, to heal the differences between the two religions, and to restore
to the church its ancient and prosperous unity. In their opinion,
and in that of many eminent men, the main obstacle to this was the
question of celibacy. It was evidently hopeless to expect this sacrifice
of the Lutheran pastors, while numerous members of the Catholic
church regarded the change as essential to the purification of
their own establishment. The only mode of effecting so desirable a
reconciliation was therefore to persuade the pope to exercise the
power of dispensation which the council of Trent had admitted to
be inherent in his high office. The spirit of the papal court, however,
was that which Pallavicini attributes to the council—that the
heretics were to be cut off, and not to be cajoled into returning.
Pius IV. himself was not personally averse to the plan so persistently
urged upon him, but those around him saw greater dangers in
concession than in refusal. De Thou, indeed, says that he was
inclined to grant the privilege for the territories of Maximilian, but
that Philip II., at the instigation of Cardinal Pacheco, fearing an
example so dangerous to his turbulent and excitable subjects in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span>
Netherlands, opposed it strenuously, and sent Don Pedro d’Avila to
Rome, who persuaded the pope to elude the demand, by keeping
matters in suspense, and by holding out prospects of accommodation
destined never to be accomplished.<a id="FNanchor_1407_1407" href="#Footnote_1407_1407" class="fnanchor">1407</a></p>

<p>This is probably not strictly correct. Maximilian’s demand had
perhaps been rendered more pressing than respectful by the necessity
of conciliating his people in view of the war with John of Transylvania
and the Turks. Its tone was not relished at Rome, nor could
the papacy be expected to listen with as much patience to remonstrances
from a prince who had just grasped the reins of power as it
had to those of the mature and experienced Ferdinand, especially
as Maximilian had been shrewdly suspected of secretly leaning to
the tenets of the Reformers.<a id="FNanchor_1408_1408" href="#Footnote_1408_1408" class="fnanchor">1408</a> The response to Maximilian was therefore
of the sharpest. Pius replied, arguing against clerical marriage
and positively declaring that it would not be tolerated,<a id="FNanchor_1409_1409" href="#Footnote_1409_1409" class="fnanchor">1409</a> and to prevent
further trouble Cardinal Commendone was sent to warn him
that any interference with the interests of religion would be visited
with the severest penalties; in fact, he was threatened with deprivation
of the imperial title, and a convocation of the Catholic princes
for the purpose of electing a successor.<a id="FNanchor_1410_1410" href="#Footnote_1410_1410" class="fnanchor">1410</a></p>

<p>The Catholic church thus definitely accepted the ancient canons,
erected them into an article of faith, and resolved to meet whatever
consequences might flow from their maintenance. In the existing
condition of clerical morals, we are almost justified in saying that it
assumed the position attributed by St. Bernard to the Manichæans
of the twelfth century—that they took vows of continence in order
to cover their incontinence, and that marriage was the only sexual
relation which they regarded as a sin.<a id="FNanchor_1411_1411" href="#Footnote_1411_1411" class="fnanchor">1411</a> We shall see hereafter what
were the results of this abnormal position.</p>

<h2><a name="XXIX" id="XXIX">XXIX.</a><br />

THE POST-TRIDENTINE CHURCH.</h2>


<p>The great council, on which so long had hung the hopes of the
Christian world, had at last been held. The reformation of the
church, postponed by the skilful policy of the popes, had been
reached in the closing sessions, and had been hurriedly provided for.
As we have seen, the regulations which concerned the morals of the
clergy were sufficient for their purpose, if only they could be enforced,
yet as they were but the hundredth repetition of an endeavor
to conquer human nature, which had always previously failed, even
those who enacted them could have felt little faith in their efficacy.
August Baumgartner, the Bavarian ambassador, in his address to
the council, June 27th, 1562, had alluded to the prevailing belief
that any comprehensive effort to enforce the chastity required by the
canons would result in driving the mass of the Catholic clergy over
to Protestantism.<a id="FNanchor_1412_1412" href="#Footnote_1412_1412" class="fnanchor">1412</a> Since continence was held by them to be impossible,
it was thought that they would prefer to marry their concubines
as Lutherans rather than give them up as Catholics. Possibly
the fear of such untoward result may explain the slender effect
which can be discerned from a scheme of reform so laboriously
reached and so pompously heralded as the panacea for the woes
which were destroying the church.</p>

<p>Although Catherine de Medicis and her sons refused to allow the
council to be formally published in France, yet she permitted its
decrees to be freely circulated, and her bishops were at liberty to
adopt them as the code of discipline in their dioceses.<a id="FNanchor_1413_1413" href="#Footnote_1413_1413" class="fnanchor">1413</a> The diffi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">547</span>culties
raised by the Emperor Maximilian on the score of priestly
celibacy were met with a vigor on the part of Pius IV. which savored
of the thirteenth rather than the sixteenth century. Philip II., after
some hesitation, ordered the reception of the council in all his dominions,
which extended from Naples to the North Sea;<a id="FNanchor_1414_1414" href="#Footnote_1414_1414" class="fnanchor">1414</a> and Poland,
despite some opposition from an ambitious prelate, submitted to it
before the year 1564 was ended.<a id="FNanchor_1415_1415" href="#Footnote_1415_1415" class="fnanchor">1415</a></p>

<p>As an authoritative exposition of the law of the church of Christ,
conceived and elaborated under the influence of the Holy Ghost, and
commanded for implicit observance by the Vicegerent of God; as
the expression of the needs and wants of the Catholic faith, wrought
by the concentrated energy and wisdom of the leading doctors of
Christendom, and transmitted for practical application through the
wondrous machinery of the Catholic hierarchy, it should have had
an immediate influence on the evils which it was intended to eradicate.
Those evils had confessedly done much to create and foster
the schism under which the church was reeling; their magnitude
was admitted by all, and no one ventured to defend or to palliate
them. Their removal was acknowledged to be a necessity of the
gravest character, and every adherent of Catholicism was bound to
lend his aid to the good work. What, then, was accomplished by
the Council which had for so long a period labored ostensibly with
the object of restoring Latin Christianity to its primitive purity?</p>

<p>Pius IV. rested satisfied with promulgating and confirming the
decrees of the council, and waited to see them produce their destined
effect. In 1566, however, he was succeeded by Pius V., whose experience
as grand inquisitor had doubtless rendered him familiar with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span>
the prevailing neglect of ecclesiastical discipline, while his unbending
temper made him rigorous in his determination to restore it. One
of the earliest acts of his pontificate was the publication of a Bull
commanding the ordinaries of all churches to put in force the Tridentine
canons respecting concubinary priests, thus showing that
already they were treated with contempt,<a id="FNanchor_1416_1416" href="#Footnote_1416_1416" class="fnanchor">1416</a> while a special mandate
on the subject, addressed to the Archbishop of Salzburg, describes
the unchecked corruption of the German priesthood as threatening
the speedy destruction of the Catholic religion there.<a id="FNanchor_1417_1417" href="#Footnote_1417_1417" class="fnanchor">1417</a> Two years
later he found it necessary to issue another Bull, directed against
darker crimes, the deplorable prevalence of which can hardly be
attributed to any additional and unaccustomed vigor in removing the
female companions of the clergy,<a id="FNanchor_1418_1418" href="#Footnote_1418_1418" class="fnanchor">1418</a> for the Archbishop of Salzburg,
in reply to a fresh command to reform his church, had replied that
he and his suffragans had never ceased to attempt it, but that all their
efforts had been fruitless and that he despaired of success.<a id="FNanchor_1419_1419" href="#Footnote_1419_1419" class="fnanchor">1419</a> Even a
worse experience befell Bernardt Rasfeldt, Bishop of Munster, who,
in his synod of 1566, published a papal brief commanding the dismissal
of clerical concubines, for his action roused the fury of his
canons to such a degree that they forced him to resign his bishopric
and spend the rest of his days in obscurity. He was succeeded by
Johann von Hoya, Bishop of Osnabruck and President of the Imperial
Chamber, a man distinguished by his birth and learning, but
who speedily wearied of the conflict and sought peace by imitating
the example of his subordinates.<a id="FNanchor_1420_1420" href="#Footnote_1420_1420" class="fnanchor">1420</a></p>

<p>In 1571 Pius undertook another subject of reform. Notwithstanding
the decree of the council that any action of clerical fathers
for the benefit of their offspring should be considered as fraudulent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">549</span>
the transmission of ecclesiastical property to such illegitimate heirs
continued almost unchecked, and Pius recognized the necessity of
further legislation to diminish the abuse. His Bull on the subject is
drawn up with a care and minuteness which show the magnitude of
the evil and the extreme difficulty of preventing it.<a id="FNanchor_1421_1421" href="#Footnote_1421_1421" class="fnanchor">1421</a> Nor was there
only the need of preserving the possessions of the church; the scandal
of sacerdotal families required repression, and all other means
having apparently failed, in 1572 another decretal declared that such
children were incapable of receiving even the private and patrimonial
property of their fathers.<a id="FNanchor_1422_1422" href="#Footnote_1422_1422" class="fnanchor">1422</a> These successive edicts are a full confession
that the long-promised reformation was a failure, and that, while
the council might regulate doctrine, it was utterly powerless to enforce
discipline. The papal fulminations proved equally powerless, and
Rome itself apparently winked at contraventions of the rule, which
could be rendered profitable by the prerogative of issuing dispensations.
In 1610 the Synod of Augsburg found it necessary to declare
that it would enforce the Tridentine canons prohibiting the illegitimate
sons of priests from holding preferment in their father’s benefices,
notwithstanding what dispensations they might produce to the
contrary.<a id="FNanchor_1423_1423" href="#Footnote_1423_1423" class="fnanchor">1423</a></p>

<p>Yet even these legislative labors of the pope are less instructive
than the war which he commenced against the courtesans of Rome.
If the new enactments could have been expected to command respect,
the example should have been set in the Holy City itself, but Pius
IV. had allowed the most public and scandalous immorality to flourish
unchecked under his immediate supervision. In 1538 the “Consilium
de Emendanda Ecclesia” had animadverted upon the cynical
licentiousness of the Roman clergy in terms which show that not
much improvement had taken place since Petrarch’s description of
the papal court,<a id="FNanchor_1424_1424" href="#Footnote_1424_1424" class="fnanchor">1424</a> and the thirty years which had intervened had not
served to purify it. Pius V. felt the disgrace keenly, and resolved
on its suppression. He at first proposed to put an end to the nefari<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">550</span>ous
trade, and to banish all the public women who would not give a
pledge of reformation by an immediate marriage. Forced to relinquish
this measure as impracticably harsh, he contented himself by
restricting their residence to certain houses, and forbade their plying
their vocation in the streets by day or night. Although he thus
admitted the necessity of the evil, and endeavored to restrain only
its public manifestation, even this moderate attempt at reform was
deemed insufferable. The clergy were ashamed to offer opposition
openly, but found no difficulty in urging the Senate to strenuous
resistance. The remonstrance made by that body shows not only
the frightful extent of the prevalent immorality, but also the settled
conviction that immorality was inseparable from celibacy. It was
represented that if the proposed rules were enforced, the prosperity
of the city would be destroyed and the rents of houses be reduced
to nothing; moreover, it was urged that, amid so vast a number of
men condemned to celibacy, if any such restrictions were put in
force, it would be impossible to preserve the virtue of the wives and
daughters of the citizens. The contest was stubbornly continued
until at length Pius was driven to declare that, if any further difficulty
were interposed, he would abandon the city.<a id="FNanchor_1425_1425" href="#Footnote_1425_1425" class="fnanchor">1425</a></p>

<p>In spite of these well-meant but nugatory efforts of Pius, the
immorality of the papal court itself and of its highest dignitaries
was admitted by a Bull which Sixtus V. promulgated in 1586. In
decreeing that no one who had children, even if they were legitimate,
should be eligible to the cardinalate, he took care to let the world
understand the cause of the restriction by declaring that in no other
way could evidence be had of the observance of their vows.<a id="FNanchor_1426_1426" href="#Footnote_1426_1426" class="fnanchor">1426</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If Pius V. met with opposition in the task of purifying the Augean
stable of Rome, St. Charles Borromeo, encouraged and stimulated
by his example, found himself involved in a more dangerous quarrel
when he attempted, in the equally demoralized city of Milan, to
enforce respect for the decrees of Trent. In 1569 he undertook to
reform the canons of S. Maria della Scala, whose licentious mode of
life was a scandal to the faithful. So persistently did they deny their
subjection to his archiepiscopal jurisdiction, that, after a long discussion,
his only resource for vindicating his authority was excommuni<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">551</span>cation.
The contumacious canons were still indisposed to yield, and,
assembling in their church, they maltreated his messenger. Thinking
that his presence might bring them to reason, he ventured himself
to expostulate with them, and found them drawn up in their
cemetery, with arms in their hands, and supported by soldiers whom
they had hired. On reaching the gate, he dismounted from his mule
and advanced towards them with his cross, which he had snatched
from his cross-bearer. Unabashed by this symbol at once of religion
and authority, the mutinous canons rushed upon him with shouts of
“Spagna,” “Spagna,” brandishing their weapons and discharging
their fire-arms at the cross in his hands—fortunately without injuring
him. Having thus driven him off, they continued for some time in
open rebellion, until they were at length obliged to submit, when
Pius V. and Philip II. united their power in support of St. Charles.<a id="FNanchor_1427_1427" href="#Footnote_1427_1427" class="fnanchor">1427</a></p>

<p>Still greater was the peril to which the saint was exposed in his
quarrel with the Umiliati. They were a branch of the Benedictine
order, founded in 1180 by the Milanese who escaped the destruction
of their city by Frederic Barbarossa. Sharing in the general license
of the age, the excesses of the Umiliati became so infamous that
they surpassed in turpitude the worst exploits of the unbridled youth
of the city. Supported by the decretals of Pius, in 1568 St.
Charles undertook to reduce the order to the observance of monastic
rule. The Umiliati resisted with so much energy and success that,
after two years of contest, they were still defiant. Regarding St.
Charles as the cause of all their troubles, Girolamo Lignana, Provost
of S. Cristoforo di Vercelli, who assumed their leadership in
1570, engaged a monk of the order named Girolamo Donati to
murder him. The blackness of the deed was not relieved by the
circumstances under which it was attempted. While the holy archbishop
was absorbed at midnight in his devotions, Donati stole into
the oratory and discharged full upon him an arquebuss loaded with
slugs. Some of the missiles struck St. Charles, but rebounded to
the floor, leaving him unhurt, and the miraculous nature of his
escape was proved by the depth to which others penetrated the walls.
At this moment the policy of Philip the Catholic supported the disaffected
and rebellious monks, and for some time yet they escaped
the retribution due to their many crimes, but at length those con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">552</span>cerned
in the attempted murder were caught and executed, and the
order of the Umiliati was broken up.<a id="FNanchor_1428_1428" href="#Footnote_1428_1428" class="fnanchor">1428</a></p>

<p>These examples sufficiently show how little the great body of
ecclesiastics was disposed to submit to a curtailment of the license
which had become traditional, and how little respect was paid either
to the commands of the great Œcumenic Council, or to the general
and local authorities. It is easy to imagine that few prelates were
so disposed to court martyrdom as the saintly Charles, and that
churches with less conscientious pastors easily found means to
purchase or compel exemption from the laws which bound them to
morality. In fact, President d’Espeisses, in his memorial presented
to Henry III. in 1583, against the publication of the council in
France, drew one of his arguments from the greater corruption of
the Italian church, where, though the council was received without
demur, yet none of its orders reforming the morals of the clergy
received the least attention.<a id="FNanchor_1429_1429" href="#Footnote_1429_1429" class="fnanchor">1429</a> That the Tridentine canons in this
respect were wholly inefficacious throughout Italy, and that the
officials, with rare exceptions, did not venture to enforce them, can
indeed be seen in the series of provincial councils held during the
remainder of the century, from Lombardy to Naples.</p>

<p>The papacy had succeeded in crushing the reformers who had
responded in so many Italian cities to the uprising in Germany; it
had then convoked and managed at its will the great Congress of
Catholic Christendom which was to put an end at once and forever
to all the evils which had led to the schism; it had every opportunity
and every motive for vindicating itself from the aspersions of its
enemies, and yet we see it at once recur to the old machinery of
local councils enacting canons whose frequency and wordy severity
are the inverse measure of their efficiency. Had the promises of
reform so liberally made been possible in their fulfilment, there had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">553</span>
been no need of further legislation. A convocation of the ecclesiastics
of each province to receive and publish the decrees of Trent
would have been all-sufficient. When, therefore, we see the endless
iteration with which the guilty clergy were threatened with the Tridentine
canons, and with other new or revivified penalties—as at the
councils of Milan in 1565 and 1582,<a id="FNanchor_1430_1430" href="#Footnote_1430_1430" class="fnanchor">1430</a> and at those of Manfredonia
in 1567, of Ravenna in 1568, of Urbino in 1569, of Florence in
1573, of Naples in 1576, of Consenza in 1579, of Salerno in 1596,
of S. Severino in 1597, and of Melfi in 1597<a id="FNanchor_1431_1431" href="#Footnote_1431_1431" class="fnanchor">1431</a>—we can only conclude
that the evil was irremediable, in spite of the well-meant efforts
to suppress it, or to throw off the responsibility of its existence.</p>

<p>In fact, the manner in which the council of Trent was greeted by
the clergy may be judged from its treatment in the archiepiscopate of
Utrecht. Though Philip II. had authoritatively ordered its reception
in 1565, we find the Duke of Alva in May, 1568, issuing his
commands to the prelates of the five churches of Utrecht to offer no
further opposition to it. Even so stern a ruler could not obtain
immediate obedience, however, to so obnoxious a series of regulations,
and they responded by pleading their ancient privileges. This
availed them little, for in June he replied that his instructions were
positive, and he proceeded to enforce them by sending royal commissioners
to the province, empowered to carry them out. In July,
therefore, the Archbishop assembled his clergy and in conjunction
with the commissioners issued a series of regulations designed to
give effective force to the canons of the council. Visiting nunneries
and haunting taverns, joining in dances and hunting and indecent
songs were forbidden. The clergy were ordered to shave their beards
and to give up their concubines, whom they were not to retake or
to replace. Even yet they did not yield, but while they were
ashamed to claim the right to keep their female companions, they
demurred as to the sacrifice of their beards, and the Archbishop was
obliged to issue another peremptory command.<a id="FNanchor_1432_1432" href="#Footnote_1432_1432" class="fnanchor">1432</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">554</span></p>

<p>Throughout the whole extent of Central Europe the Tridentine
canons met with a like slackness of obedience. Even the question
of sacerdotal marriage, which had been raised by the council to the
dignity of a point of faith, was stubbornly contested, and was not
yielded until after a protracted struggle.</p>

<p>In 1569 we find the synod of the extensive and important province
of Salzburg virtually dividing its clergy into two classes—those who
haunt the taverns under pretext of getting their meals, but really
for the purpose of indulging in drunken riots with their parishioners,
and those who keep houses, with concubines under the guise of female
servants, whom they secretly marry, and who are openly known by
their husbands’ names. To meet this condition of affairs, the synod
devised an elaborate system by which the richer clergy were directed
to keep as domestics respectable middle-aged married women with
their husbands, while the poorer ecclesiastics were to club together
for the same purpose.<a id="FNanchor_1433_1433" href="#Footnote_1433_1433" class="fnanchor">1433</a> This expedient proved as fruitless as its predecessors,
for in 1572 Gregory XIII. complained to the archbishop
that in many places priests who were known to be married were permitted
by their bishops to celebrate Mass and to handle the sacred
elements.<a id="FNanchor_1434_1434" href="#Footnote_1434_1434" class="fnanchor">1434</a> In spite of all this the evil continued unabated, and in
1616 the Archbishop of Salzburg, in his instructions for a general
visitation, ordered that all priests should remove their concubines to
a distance of at least six miles, and should not allow their illegitimate
children to live openly with them, except under special license
from him.<a id="FNanchor_1435_1435" href="#Footnote_1435_1435" class="fnanchor">1435</a></p>

<p>In 1565, Anthony, Archbishop of Prague, promulgated the council
of Trent in his provincial synod. He was a man of more than ordinary
vigor; he had been the imperial orator at Trent, understood
fully the views of the council, and was not likely to underrate either
their importance or their authority. Armed with the Tridentine
canons, he set actively to work and instituted a very thorough system
of inquisitorial visitations, which ought to have succeeded if success
were possible. Yet, after the lapse of thirteen years, in a special
mandate issued by him in 1578, he deplores the obstinate blindness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">555</span>
of many of his clergy, who still believed, with the heretics, that
marriage was not incompatible with priesthood, while those who did
not marry were guilty of the less dangerous error of maintaining
concubines and children on the revenues of their benefices.<a id="FNanchor_1436_1436" href="#Footnote_1436_1436" class="fnanchor">1436</a></p>

<p>The same wilful ignorance apparently existed in the diocese of
Wurzburg, for Bishop Julius, in 1584, found it necessary, in his
episcopal statutes, to discountenance clerical matrimony and to prove
its nullity by laboriously quoting innumerable canons and decretals;
and he even condescended to remind his priesthood that in taking
orders they had willingly and knowingly entered into an engagement
of continence, by the consequences of which they must be prepared
to abide.<a id="FNanchor_1437_1437" href="#Footnote_1437_1437" class="fnanchor">1437</a></p>

<p>A provincial synod of Gnesen, of which the date is uncertain, but
which was probably held in 1577, deplored the insane audacity displayed
by ecclesiastics in marrying, and threatened them with the
Tridentine anathema.<a id="FNanchor_1438_1438" href="#Footnote_1438_1438" class="fnanchor">1438</a> This warning appears to have been completely
disregarded, for the Bishop of Breslau, a suffragan of the
metropolis of Gnesen, in opening his diocesan synod in 1580, still
complained that many of his clergy were guilty of this perversity,
and he was at some pains to disavow any complicity with it, or any
connivance at the licentiousness which was prevalent among the unmarried.<a id="FNanchor_1439_1439" href="#Footnote_1439_1439" class="fnanchor">1439</a>
In 1591 the synod of Olmutz asserted that many clerks
in holy orders contracted pretended marriages, and were not ashamed
of the families growing up publicly around them, while others indulged
in scandalous concubinage with women, whom they styled house-keepers
or cooks. In endeavoring to put an end to this state of
affairs, the synod manifested its estimation of the morals of the
priesthood by renewing the hideous suggestions which we have seen
in the tenth and twelfth centuries, for pastors were allowed to have
near them the female relatives authorized by the Nicene canons, but,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">556</span>
in view of the assaults of the tempter, were prudently advised not
to let them reside in their houses.<a id="FNanchor_1440_1440" href="#Footnote_1440_1440" class="fnanchor">1440</a> The disregard of the Tridentine
canon continued, and as late as 1628, at the synod of Osnabruck,
the orator who opened the proceedings inveighed in the vilest terms
against the female companions of the clergy, who not only occupied
the position of wives, but were even dignified with the title.<a id="FNanchor_1441_1441" href="#Footnote_1441_1441" class="fnanchor">1441</a></p>

<p>Even in Spain, under Philip II., the new ideas had penetrated,
and priestly marriages became sufficiently numerous to render it
necessary for the Inquisition to add to its “Edict of Denunciations,”
which was read during Lent in every church, a command to reveal
to the authorities any case of marriage on the part of monks or of
ecclesiastics in holy orders.<a id="FNanchor_1442_1442" href="#Footnote_1442_1442" class="fnanchor">1442</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have seen above that the highest authorities in the church did
not hesitate openly to attribute the origin and success of the Reformation
to the scandalous corruption of the ecclesiastical body. The
council of Trent had not resulted in removing the scandal, and clear-sighted
prelates were not wanting who proclaimed that the same
causes continued to operate and to produce the same effect. Anthony,
Archbishop of Prague, in his synod of 1565, took occasion to declare
that the misfortunes of the church were attributable to the dissoluteness
of the clergy, and that the extirpation of heresy could best be
effected by reforming the depraved morals and filthy lives of ecclesiastics.<a id="FNanchor_1443_1443" href="#Footnote_1443_1443" class="fnanchor">1443</a>
At the council of Salzburg, in 1569, Christopher Spandel,
in the closing address, asked the assembled prelates what title was
more contemptible or more odious than that of priest in consequence
of the license in which the clergy as a body indulged.<a id="FNanchor_1444_1444" href="#Footnote_1444_1444" class="fnanchor">1444</a> The clergy
of France, assembled at Melun in July, 1579, when addressing Henry
III. with a request for the publication of the council of Trent, assured
him that the heresy which afflicted Christendom was caused by the
corruption of the church, and that it could only be eradicated by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">557</span>
thorough reformation.<a id="FNanchor_1445_1445" href="#Footnote_1445_1445" class="fnanchor">1445</a> Though the Inquisition took care that Spain
should not be much troubled by heretics, yet the synod of Orihuella,
in 1600, declared that the concubinage practised by ecclesiastics was
the principal source of popular animosity and complaint against them.<a id="FNanchor_1446_1446" href="#Footnote_1446_1446" class="fnanchor">1446</a>
These complaints were general. In 1599, Cuyck, Bishop of Ruremonde,
published a work aimed at concubinary priests, in which he
assured them that they and their predecessors were the cause of the
ruin and devastation of the Netherlands for the last thirty years, for
their vices had led to the contempt felt for the clergy, and thus to
the heresy which had caused the civil wars. Those who kept their
vows he asserts to be as rare as the grapes that can be gleaned after
the vintage or the olives left after gathering the crop; but the only
remedy he can suggest is increased vigilance and severity on the part
of the prelates.<a id="FNanchor_1447_1447" href="#Footnote_1447_1447" class="fnanchor">1447</a> Evidently, the Tridentine canons had thus far been
a failure. In 1609, at the synod of Constance, the Rev. Dr. Hamerer,
in an official oration to the assembled prelates, deplored the
continued spread of heresy, which he boldly told them was caused
by the perpetually increasing immorality that pervaded all classes
of the priesthood. The Reformation had begun, had derived its
strength, and was still prospering through their weakness, which
rendered them odious to the people, and made the Catholic religion
a by-word and a shame.<a id="FNanchor_1448_1448" href="#Footnote_1448_1448" class="fnanchor">1448</a> In 1610, the Bishop of Antwerp, in a
synodal address, agreed with Bishop Cuyck in attributing the evils
which had so grievously afflicted the church of Flanders for nearly
half a century, to the same cause, and, while recounting the various
successive efforts at internal reform made since the council of Trent,
he pronounced each one to have been a failure in consequence of the
incurable obstinacy of the clergy.<a id="FNanchor_1449_1449" href="#Footnote_1449_1449" class="fnanchor">1449</a> Damhouder, a celebrated jurisconsult
of Flanders, whose unquestioned piety and orthodoxy gained
for him the confidence of Charles V. and Philip II., does not hesitate
to speak of the clergy of his time as men who rarely lived up
to their professions, and who as a general rule were scoundrels distinguished
for their indulgence in all manner of evil.<a id="FNanchor_1450_1450" href="#Footnote_1450_1450" class="fnanchor">1450</a> In a similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">558</span>
mood the Bishop of Bois-le-Duc, in opening his synod of 1612, declared
that the scandalous lives of the ecclesiastics were a source of
corruption to the laity and a direct encouragement of heresy.<a id="FNanchor_1451_1451" href="#Footnote_1451_1451" class="fnanchor">1451</a> So,
in 1625, the synod of Osnabruck gave as its reason for endeavoring
to enforce the Tridentine canons that the true religion was despised
on account of the depraved morals of its ministers, whose crimes
were a sufficient explanation of the stubbornness of the heretics.
So little concealment of their frailty was thought necessary that they
openly enriched their children from the patrimony of the church,
and decked their concubines with ornaments and vestments taken
from the holy images, even as we have seen was the custom among
the Anglo-Saxons of the tenth century.<a id="FNanchor_1452_1452" href="#Footnote_1452_1452" class="fnanchor">1452</a></p>

<p>The Thirty Years’ War proved a more effectual bar to the spread
of heresy than these fruitless efforts to cure the incurable malady of
the church. After the Peace of Westphalia, there was no further
need to appeal to the dread of proselyting Lutheranism as a stimulus
to virtue, but still the same process of reasoning appears in exhortations
to regain the forfeited respect of the community. Thus, in
1652, the Bishop of Munster expressed his horror at the obstinacy
with which, in spite of fines, edicts, and canons, his clergy persisted
in retaining their concubines, and he declared that the discordance
between the professions and the practice of the priesthood rendered
them a stench in the nostrils of the people and destroyed the authority
of religion itself;<a id="FNanchor_1453_1453" href="#Footnote_1453_1453" class="fnanchor">1453</a> and in 1662 the synod of Cologne deplored
that the notorious want of respect felt for the ministers of Christ was
the direct result of their own immorality.<a id="FNanchor_1454_1454" href="#Footnote_1454_1454" class="fnanchor">1454</a> A doctrine even sprang
up to the effect that it was not requisite to force a concubinarian to
eject his companion if she was useful to him in his housekeeping or if
it would be difficult for him to obtain another servant; and this became
sufficiently formidable to entitle it to a place among the errors
of belief formally condemned by the Roman Inquisition in its decree
of March, 1666.<a id="FNanchor_1455_1455" href="#Footnote_1455_1455" class="fnanchor">1455</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In France the influence of the Tridentine canons had been equally
unsatisfactory. At a royal council held in 1560, which resolved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">559</span>
upon the assembly of the States at Orleans, Charles de Marillac,
Bishop of Vienne, declared that ecclesiastical discipline was almost
obsolete, and that no previous time had seen scandals so frequent or
the life of the clergy so reprehensible.<a id="FNanchor_1456_1456" href="#Footnote_1456_1456" class="fnanchor">1456</a> From the proceedings of
the Huguenot Synod of Poitiers, in 1560, it is evident that priests
not infrequently secretly married their concubines, and, when the
woman was a Calvinist, her equivocal position became a matter of
grave consideration with her church.<a id="FNanchor_1457_1457" href="#Footnote_1457_1457" class="fnanchor">1457</a> The only result of the Colloquy
of Poissy, in 1561, was that Catherine de Medicis prevailed
upon the bishops to present a request to the king asking him to use
his influence with the pope to concede the marriage of priests and
the use of the cup by the laity. Means were found, as we have seen,
to prevent the former of these demands from being made, while the
latter, when presented, was peremptorily refused.<a id="FNanchor_1458_1458" href="#Footnote_1458_1458" class="fnanchor">1458</a> In the existing
condition of affairs, the council of Trent could not reasonably be
expected to effect much, for, as the orthodox Claude d’Espence
informs us, the French prelates, like the Germans, were in the habit
of collecting the “cullagium” from all their priests and informing
those who did not keep concubines that they might do so if they
liked, but must pay the license-money, whether or no.<a id="FNanchor_1459_1459" href="#Footnote_1459_1459" class="fnanchor">1459</a> In 1564,
the Cardinal of Lorraine, not long after his return from the council,
held a provincial synod at Rheims, where he contented himself with
declaring that the ancient canons enjoining chastity should be enforced.<a id="FNanchor_1460_1460" href="#Footnote_1460_1460" class="fnanchor">1460</a>
The next year, 1565, a synod held at Cambray reduced the
penalties to a minimum, and afforded every opportunity for purchasing
immunity, by enacting that those who consorted with loose women,
and who remained obdurate to warnings and reprehension, should be
punished at the pleasure of the officials.<a id="FNanchor_1461_1461" href="#Footnote_1461_1461" class="fnanchor">1461</a> In two years more the
same council was fain to ask the aid of the secular arm to remove
the concubines of its clergy<a id="FNanchor_1462_1462" href="#Footnote_1462_1462" class="fnanchor">1462</a>—a course again suggested as late as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">560</span>
1631.<a id="FNanchor_1463_1463" href="#Footnote_1463_1463" class="fnanchor">1463</a> The terms in which Claude, Bishop of Evreux, at his synod
of 1576, announced his intention of taking steps to eject those who
for the future should persist in their immorality show not only that
such measures were even yet an innovation, but also indicate little
probability of their being successful.<a id="FNanchor_1464_1464" href="#Footnote_1464_1464" class="fnanchor">1464</a> The council of Rheims, in
1583, while proclaiming that the Tridentine canons shall be enforced
on all concubinary priests, manifests a reasonable doubt as to the
amount of respect which they will receive in threatening that those
who are contumacious shall be subdued by the secular arm.<a id="FNanchor_1465_1465" href="#Footnote_1465_1465" class="fnanchor">1465</a> The
council of Tours, in the same year, deplores that the whole ecclesiastical
body is regarded with aversion by the good and pious on
account of the scandals perpetrated by a portion of them. To cure
this evil, the residence of suspected women, even when connected by
blood, is forbidden, as well as of the children acknowledged to be
sprung from such unions, and various penalties are denounced against
offenders.<a id="FNanchor_1466_1466" href="#Footnote_1466_1466" class="fnanchor">1466</a> The council of Avignon, in 1594, declares that the numerous
decrees relative to the morals and manners of the clergy are
either forgotten or neglected, and then proceeds to forbid the residence
of suspected women.<a id="FNanchor_1467_1467" href="#Footnote_1467_1467" class="fnanchor">1467</a> That of Bordeaux, in 1624, earnestly
warns the clergy of the province not to allow their sisters and nieces
to live in their houses, and especially not to sleep in the same room
with them;<a id="FNanchor_1468_1468" href="#Footnote_1468_1468" class="fnanchor">1468</a> and various other synods held during the period repeated
the well-known regulations on the subject, which are only of interest
as showing how little they were respected.<a id="FNanchor_1469_1469" href="#Footnote_1469_1469" class="fnanchor">1469</a></p>

<p>No one, in fact, who is familiar with the popular literature of
France during that period can avoid the conviction that the ecclesiastical
body was hopelessly infected with the corruption which, emanating
from the foulest court in Christendom, spread its contagion
throughout the land. If Rabelais and Bonaventure des Periers
reflect the depravity which was universal under Francis I., Bran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">561</span>tôme,
Beroalde de Verville and Noël du Fail continue the record of
infamy under Catherine de Medicis and her children.<a id="FNanchor_1470_1470" href="#Footnote_1470_1470" class="fnanchor">1470</a> The genealogy
of sin is carried on by Tallemant des Réaux, Bussy-Rabutin,
and the crowd of memoir writers who flourished in the Augustan age
of French literature. Into these common sewers of iniquity it is
not worth our while to penetrate; but, when the high places in the
hierarchy were filled with men to whom the very name of virtue was
a jest, we need not hesitate to conclude that the humbler members
of the church were equally regardless of their obligations to God
and man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is evident from all this that the standard of ecclesiastical morals
had not been raised by the efforts of the Tridentine fathers, and yet
a study of the records of church discipline shows that with the
increasing decency and refinement of society during the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries the open and cynical manifestations of
license among the clergy became gradually rarer. It may well be
doubted, nevertheless, whether their lives were in reality much purer.
A few spasmodic efforts were made to enforce the Nicene canon, prohibiting
the residence of women, but they were utterly fruitless, and
were so recognized by all parties; and the energies of the arch-priests
and bishops were directed to regulating the character of the handmaidens,
who were admitted to be a necessary evil. The devices
employed for this purpose were varied, and repeated with a frequency
which shows their insufficiency; and it would be scarce worth our
while to do more than indicate some sources of reference for the
curious student who may wish to follow up the reiteration which we
have traced already through so many successive centuries.<a id="FNanchor_1471_1471" href="#Footnote_1471_1471" class="fnanchor">1471</a> Among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">562</span>
them, however, one new feature shows itself, which indicates the
growing respect paid to the appearance of decency—complaints that
concubines are kept under the guise of sisters and nieces.</p>

<p>That the monastic orders had profited more than the secular clergy
by the Tridentine reformation may well be doubted. Laurent de Peyrinnis,
one of the heads of the Order of Minims, in 1668, issued a
code of regulations in which he showed that scandal was more
dreaded than sin when he promulgated an exemption from excommunication
in favor of those brethren who, when about to yield to
the temptations of the flesh, or to commit theft, prudently laid aside
the monastic habit.<a id="FNanchor_1472_1472" href="#Footnote_1472_1472" class="fnanchor">1472</a> Another celebrated jurist of the same Order
bears testimony to the demoralization of his brethren when he declares
that if the severe punishments provided for unchastity by the
statutes were enforced they would result in the destruction of all the
religious congregations.<a id="FNanchor_1473_1473" href="#Footnote_1473_1473" class="fnanchor">1473</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the New World the licentiousness of the priesthood, as might
be expected, began to vex the infant church as soon as it was organized
among the heathen. The earliest synods and councils which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">563</span>
were held contain the customary denunciations of concubinage and
prohibitions for ecclesiastics to keep their children in their houses,
to celebrate their baptisms and nuptials, and to be assisted by them
in the ministry of the altar. Many, as we are informed by the first
council of Mexico, held in 1555, brought with them from Spain their
concubines under the guise of relatives.<a id="FNanchor_1474_1474" href="#Footnote_1474_1474" class="fnanchor">1474</a> For the most part, however,
they formed connections with the natives.</p>

<p>In fact, the institution of slavery and the subject populations
among whom its ministers were scattered gave rise to fresh problems,
which the church sought perseveringly, but vainly, to solve. Thus,
in New Grenada, before the conquest was fairly achieved, Bishop
Barrios, of Santafé, held his first synod, in 1556, and there, after
premising that the fruits of religion among the Indians depended
upon the good example of their pastors, he proceeded to prohibit any
priest stationed in an Indian town from having any Indian woman
residing in his house; his food was to be cooked by men, or, if this
was impossible, his female servant must be a married woman, residing
with her husband under another roof<a id="FNanchor_1475_1475" href="#Footnote_1475_1475" class="fnanchor">1475</a>—a provision repeated by the
synod of Lima in 1585.<a id="FNanchor_1476_1476" href="#Footnote_1476_1476" class="fnanchor">1476</a> A curious experiment in dealing with the
troubles arising from slavery is seen in the Mexican canons, which
directed that if an ecclesiastic had children by his slave, the ownership
of the woman was to be transferred to the church and the children
were to be set free. It will be remembered (p. 178) that in
1022 the church insisted upon the continued servitude of clerical
bastards whose mothers were serfs of the church; and the contrast
between this and the regulation which proclaimed the freedom of the
children as a punishment inflicted upon the father is perhaps the
sorriest exhibit that could be made of the character of those who were
engaged in spreading the teachings of Christ among the heathen.<a id="FNanchor_1477_1477" href="#Footnote_1477_1477" class="fnanchor">1477</a></p>

<p>While there can be no doubt that much heroic self-devotion was
shown in the efforts made to convert the new subjects of Spain, it is
equally unquestionable that a majority of the ecclesiastics who sought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">564</span>
the colonies were men of the worst description. The councils held
in the several provinces deplore the evil example which they set to
their newly converted flocks, and the regulations which were issued
time and again against their excesses show the impossibility of keeping
them under control. In Peru, for instance, when in 1581 St.
Toribio commenced the quarter of a century of labor as Archbishop
which worthily won for him the canonization accorded by Benedict
XIII. in 1726, two councils had already been held in Lima, one in
1552 and the other in 1567, which had essayed a reformation of
morals. He, in turn, lost no time in summoning a provincial
council, which assembled in 1583, the decrees of which, in their
denunciation of all manner of vices, show how ineffectual the previous
efforts had been. The clergy were not disposed to submit tamely
to the new restraints which Toribio sought to impose, and, while the
active resistance which some of them raised was subdued, the underhand
management of others was so far successful that the royal
assent to the proceedings of the council was delayed till 1591.<a id="FNanchor_1478_1478" href="#Footnote_1478_1478" class="fnanchor">1478</a>
Notwithstanding the activity of Toribio, who, between 1583 and
1604, held three provincial councils and ten diocesan synods, who
three times personally visited every portion of his vast archbishopric,
and who repeatedly ordered his vicars to send secret reports of concubinary
and dissolute priests, he was obliged, in the provincial
council of 1601, to content himself with renewing the regulations
of 1583, sorrowfully observing that they had received scant obedience,
and that consequently the corruption and abuses prevalent
among the clergy deprived them of usefulness among their Indian
parishioners.<a id="FNanchor_1479_1479" href="#Footnote_1479_1479" class="fnanchor">1479</a> We can thus readily understand the grief with which
the honest Fray Gerónimo de Mendieta, a contemporary, after depicting
the eager docility with which the natives at first welcomed
Christianity, contrasts it with the hatred which sprang up for the
very name of Christian when they realized the hopeless wretchedness
of their position under their new taskmasters; and the Fray
does not conceal the fact that this was partly owing to the character
of some of the clergy, while the better ones were disheartened and
discharged their trusts mechanically, without expectation of accomp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">565</span>lishing
good.<a id="FNanchor_1480_1480" href="#Footnote_1480_1480" class="fnanchor">1480</a> This condition of morals did not improve with time.
In his official report of 1736, the Marques del Castel-Fuerte, Viceroy
of Peru, remarks that the greater portion of those of Spanish
blood born in the colonies embraced an ecclesiastical life, as offering
an easier and more assured career than any other. Surrounded by
their Indian subjects, the pastors lived in luxury and license, which
their superiors did little or nothing to check. In 1728 the civil
power was ordered to make an investigation into the morals of the
priesthood, and especially to designate those whose concubinage was
open and notorious—an invasion of the sacred immunities of the
church which provoked a storm against the secular authorities,
although only an examination was proposed, and there was no
attempt to be made of conviction or punishment.<a id="FNanchor_1481_1481" href="#Footnote_1481_1481" class="fnanchor">1481</a></p>

<p>That the monastic establishments shared in the general dissoluteness
we may fairly conclude when we see the precautions which
St. Toribio found necessary to preserve the purity of the spouses of
Christ. Thus one regulation provides that no ecclesiastic shall visit
a nun without a written permission, to be granted only by the Archbishop
himself, or his Provisor; and so little confidence did he feel
in the guardians whom he himself appointed, that he directs that the
official visitors who inspected the nunneries should not enter them
without some special and urgent reason.<a id="FNanchor_1482_1482" href="#Footnote_1482_1482" class="fnanchor">1482</a></p>

<p>A curious rule adopted by the first council of Mexico in 1555
shows how much more scandal was dreaded than sin. In order, as
it says, to avert danger and infamy from the clerical order and from
married women, it prohibits the Fiscal, or prosecuting officer, from
taking cognizance of cases of adultery committed by ecclesiastics,
unless the husband be a consenting party, or the adulterer makes
public boast of it, or the fact is so notorious that it cannot be passed
over in silence; and even when action thus is not to be avoided,
in no case is the name of the woman to be mentioned in the proceedings.
The Provisors, however, are not forbidden to take notice
of such crimes, but are allowed to settle them, if they can, with all
due discretion.<a id="FNanchor_1483_1483" href="#Footnote_1483_1483" class="fnanchor">1483</a> As might be expected these regulations, by giving
practical immunity, led to an increase in crime, and the third council
of Mexico in 1585 tells us that many of the clergy indulged in it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">566</span>
in preference to ordinary concubinage, in the confidence that they
would not be prosecuted; but the amended rule adopted by the Council
to meet this trouble differs so little from its predecessors, that we may
reasonably doubt whether it was followed by any diminution in the
evil.<a id="FNanchor_1484_1484" href="#Footnote_1484_1484" class="fnanchor">1484</a> And this, judging from Rivera’s notes to his edition of 1859,
is the existing state of ecclesiastical law in Mexico,<a id="FNanchor_1485_1485" href="#Footnote_1485_1485" class="fnanchor">1485</a> although the
Tridentine canon specially orders the Episcopal Ordinaries to proceed

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The church of the post-Tridentine period began to find a darker
and more dangerous sin attract closer attention than of old, and call
for more serious efforts to prevent its offending the awakened consciousness
of the faithful. The power of the confessional, one of the
most effective instrumentalities invented by the ingenuity of man for
enslaving the human mind, was peculiarly liable to abuse in sexual
relations. No one can be familiar with the hideous suggestiveness
of the penitentials without recognizing how fearfully frequent must
be the temptations arising between confessor and penitent, while their
respective relations render seduction comparatively easy, and unspeakably
atrocious.<a id="FNanchor_1487_1487" href="#Footnote_1487_1487" class="fnanchor">1487</a> To deprive such relations of danger requires
the confessor to be gifted with rare purity and holiness, and when
these functions were confided to men such as those who composed the
sacerdotal body, as we have seen it throughout the Middle Ages, the
result was inevitable.</p>

<p>The scandals of the confessional were no new source of tribulation
to the church and the people. No sooner had the early custom of
public and lay confession tended to fall into the hands of the priesthood
than it was found necessary to call attention to the dangers
thence arising. The first council of Toledo, in 398, forbids any
familiarity between the virgins dedicated to God and their confessors.<a id="FNanchor_1488_1488" href="#Footnote_1488_1488" class="fnanchor">1488</a>
About the year 500, Symmachus calls attention to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">567</span>
spiritual affinity contracted between the confessor and his penitent,
rendering the latter his daughter; he alludes to Silvester as having
denounced guilty relations between them, and proceeds to decree not
only deposition in such cases, but life-long penitence.<a id="FNanchor_1489_1489" href="#Footnote_1489_1489" class="fnanchor">1489</a> As sacerdotal
confession gradually became customary, a decretal was forged—whether
to give additional authority to the practice, or to impress
upon the minds of confessors the necessity of prudence—by which
the name of Celestin I. was used for a regulation confiscating all the
possessions of the female delinquent and confining her in a monastery
for life, while the seducer was warned that such sin with his spiritual
daughter amounted to a grave case of adultery, for which he must be
deposed and undergo penance for twelve years, provided, always, that
the facts had become known to the people,<a id="FNanchor_1490_1490" href="#Footnote_1490_1490" class="fnanchor">1490</a> thus indicating that scandal
rather than sin was the danger most dreaded.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that this trouble should continue, as we have seen
it do throughout the whole history of a celibate priesthood.<a id="FNanchor_1491_1491" href="#Footnote_1491_1491" class="fnanchor">1491</a> That it
was the subject of frequent and indignant reprehension on the part
of those who sought to elevate and purify the church we may well
believe. Calixtus II. freely assumes the perdition of the priest who
thus betrays the sacred confidence reposed in him, denouncing him
as a lion devouring sheep, as a bear attacking a traveller who has
lost his way, as a fowler spreading lures for birds and attracting
them with sweet sounds, while the woman he treats not as a partner
in guilt, but as an unfortunate who finds destruction where she is
seeking salvation.<a id="FNanchor_1492_1492" href="#Footnote_1492_1492" class="fnanchor">1492</a> It is observable here that the fault is assumed
to lie exclusively with the confessor, and such is likewise the case in
the eloquent denunciations of Savonarola, who declares that the
Italian cities are full of these wolves in sheep’s clothing, who are
constantly seeking to entice the innocent into sin by all the arts for
which their spiritual directorship affords so much scope.<a id="FNanchor_1493_1493" href="#Footnote_1493_1493" class="fnanchor">1493</a> The extent
to which the evil sometimes grew may be guessed from a case mentioned
by Erasmus, in which a theologian of Louvain refused absolu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">568</span>tion
to a pastor who confessed to having maintained illicit relations
with no less than two hundred nuns confided to his spiritual charge.<a id="FNanchor_1494_1494" href="#Footnote_1494_1494" class="fnanchor">1494</a></p>

<p>The view which was taken of this crime during the progress of the
Reformation is set forth in a work on the Criminal Canon Law
printed in Venice in 1543, which intimates that improper relations
between a confessor and his penitents are not much worse than
ordinary concubinage, but that when they become publicly known
they should be severely punished by deprivation and imprisonment,
seeing that their notoriety tends to prevent men from allowing their
wives and daughters to confess, and exposes the sacrament of penitence
to the assaults of the heretics.<a id="FNanchor_1495_1495" href="#Footnote_1495_1495" class="fnanchor">1495</a> It was probably this worldly
wisdom which prevented the Council of Trent from alluding specifically
to the matter and endeavoring to put an end to a crime so
heinous, for assuredly it had not grown less in the ever increasing
license of the age. It is rather curious that in Spain, the only
kingdom where heresy was not allowed to get a foothold, the trouble
seems to have been greatest and to have first called for special
remedial measures. Already, in 1556, Paul IV. had addressed a
brief to the Inquisitors of Grenada, calling their attention to the
frequency of the crime and assuming that confessors who could so
abuse their office must hold unorthodox views as to the sacrament of
penitence, which rendered them suspect of heresy and thus brought
them within the jurisdiction of the Holy Office. He therefore instructed
the Inquisitors to prosecute such offenders zealously, but it
was deemed best not to attract public attention to a matter so delicate,
lest the faithful should be deterred from frequenting the confessional.
The investigations were accordingly prosecuted in secret, and the
criminals were privately punished.<a id="FNanchor_1496_1496" href="#Footnote_1496_1496" class="fnanchor">1496</a></p>

<p>Enough was discovered to show that the trouble was general, and
in 1564 Pius IV. issued a Bull addressed to the Inquisitor General,
in which, assuming like his predecessor that the offence must be
heretical, he authorized the Holy Office to prosecute it throughout
the Spanish dominions, and revoked all immunities which the monastic
orders might enjoy exempting them from local jurisdiction.<a id="FNanchor_1497_1497" href="#Footnote_1497_1497" class="fnanchor">1497</a> This
brought the subject formally within the scope of the Inquisition which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">569</span>
thenceforth took charge of it in those countries blessed with that
institution. In some portions of Spain the Inquisitors added the
crime of “solicitation” to the list of offences published in their annual
“Edict of Denunciation,” which required every one, under pain of
excommunication, to denounce to the Holy Office all cases of which
he might happen to be cognizant. Gonsalvo relates that in 1563
this was done in Seville, when it brought such a crowd of accusing
women to the Inquisition that twenty secretaries were unable to take
down the depositions, within the allotted time of thirty days, and the
limit had to be extended until it reached the term of four months,
causing finally so great a popular ferment and implicating so large a
number of ecclesiastics that the attempt had to be abandoned.<a id="FNanchor_1498_1498" href="#Footnote_1498_1498" class="fnanchor">1498</a></p>

<p>Llorente considers this to be an exaggeration, as is probably the
case, but he admits that the Conseyo de la Suprema was led to forbid
the inclusion of the offence in the Edict of Denunciation, which
greatly diminished the number of accusations, and this prohibition
was repeated in 1571, in the hope that through the machinery of the
episcopal courts the crime would be suppressed; but this expectation
proving illusory, in 1576 the Conseyo ordered the crime to be reinstated
in the Edict.<a id="FNanchor_1499_1499" href="#Footnote_1499_1499" class="fnanchor">1499</a></p>

<p>In 1608 Paul V. seems suddenly to have awakened to the necessity
of extending to Portugal the means employed in Spain, and he issued
to the Portuguese Inquisitor General a Bull similar in purport to those
of his predecessors. Little was accomplished, even in these favored
countries, and in 1622 Gregory XV. published a Bull extending to
all Christendom the provisions of the previous ones, and granting to
the episcopal courts full jurisdiction over all accused of “solicitation,”
notwithstanding whatever immunities they might otherwise enjoy; a
single witness was pronounced sufficient, when supported by circumstantial
evidence, and the punishment of those convicted was left to
the discretion of the judge, with the suggestion that it might extend
to perpetual imprisonment or condemnation to the galleys for life, or
even abandonment to the secular arm—that Inquisitorial euphuism
for the faggot and the stake.<a id="FNanchor_1500_1500" href="#Footnote_1500_1500" class="fnanchor">1500</a> Apparently these Bulls received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">570</span>
slender attention, for in 1633 a special decree directs that they shall
be read at least once a year and an emphatic warning be given in a
chapter of each order, and sworn evidence of the fact be transmitted
to the congregation of the Inquisition at Rome.<a id="FNanchor_1501_1501" href="#Footnote_1501_1501" class="fnanchor">1501</a> Even this was but
partially successful. Gregory’s Bull was not published in either
France or Germany, and for a century or more its observance throughout
those regions depended entirely upon such bishops, of whom there
were but few, who might see fit to promulgate its regulations in their
individual dioceses;<a id="FNanchor_1502_1502" href="#Footnote_1502_1502" class="fnanchor">1502</a> although the established rule of the church protected
the criminal by not permitting a woman who had been seduced
in the confessional to name her seducer to another confessor.<a id="FNanchor_1503_1503" href="#Footnote_1503_1503" class="fnanchor">1503</a></p>

<p>Even in the kingdoms where the Bull was legally received and
published, its provisions in practice seem to have been held as directed
almost exclusively against those who might be foolish enough to incur
suspicion of heresy by asserting that they were not aware of their
guilt. While the Holy Office stretched its power to convict and
punish all the wretched heretics whom it could bring within its grasp,
it was singularly tender of those whom successive popes denounced
as the worst of offenders. In a learned work on the subject, the
author, an official of the Portuguese Inquisition, urges the caution
requisite in proceedings which affect the honor of ecclesiastics, bringing
scandal and grief to the faithful and glory and joy to the heretic.
As the accused had all presumptions in his favor, since he had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">571</span>
selected for the sacred functions of the confessional, and as women
were by nature inconstant, corruptible, deceitful, mendacious, and
given to perjury, he concludes that the evidence of a single witness
is wholly inconclusive; two witnesses of good character may justify
the seclusion of the accused, either in prison or in his own convent
or house, but four were necessary to his conviction; he decides
adversely the question whether deficiency of evidence can be supplemented
by torture; and he cites Potiphar’s wife to caution his
brethren against lending too hasty credence to accusations which
may be only the revengeful promptings of a baffled tempter.<a id="FNanchor_1504_1504" href="#Footnote_1504_1504" class="fnanchor">1504</a> Casuists
were found to argue that the solicitation must occur during the act
of confession itself to bring the accused within the words of the
papal decrees, which were not applicable even if it took place in the
confessional immediately before the woman commenced to confess, or
immediately after she had received absolution.<a id="FNanchor_1505_1505" href="#Footnote_1505_1505" class="fnanchor">1505</a> The accused who
denied, might be shown the torture, but could not be exposed to it,
and if punished, his punishment must be secret, so as not to give rise
to popular disquiet.<a id="FNanchor_1506_1506" href="#Footnote_1506_1506" class="fnanchor">1506</a> In Spain, when the local tribunal had agreed
upon a sentence, it could not be executed without referring the case
and all the evidence to the Conseyo de la Suprema;<a id="FNanchor_1507_1507" href="#Footnote_1507_1507" class="fnanchor">1507</a> but the sentence
which was thus so carefully to be considered, was not usually
severe. Some instructions on the subject issued in 1577, after
premising that there must be neither public penitence nor appearance
in an auto de fé, and that the sentence, unlike that of heretics,
must be made known only to the ecclesiastics of the place, proceed
to state that the penalties to be imposed on the guilty are at the
discretion of the Tribunal, except that he is obliged to abjure the implied
heresy and is prohibited from hearing confessions in the future.
Whether he is to be suspended from administering the other sacraments,
or from preaching, and whether he is to be imprisoned or
banished from the place of his crime, must depend upon the gravity
of the offence. In grave cases, secular priests may be punished by
seclusion, or deprivation of function or benefice, or pecuniary fines,
with discipline, secret prayers and fasting; and monks may be visited
with the discipline, removal from the scene of their misdeeds, sus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">572</span>pension
or privation of orders, of the privilege of voting in their
convents, and relegation to the last place in the choir and refectory.<a id="FNanchor_1508_1508" href="#Footnote_1508_1508" class="fnanchor">1508</a>
All this manifests not only a provident care to prevent scandal among
the faithful, but a singular tolerance of crime when compared with
the severity which characterized the ordinary operations of the Inquisition,
in lapses of faith however slight. A man who asserted that
simple fornication was not a mortal sin was treated as a heretic and
“relaxed” or “reconciled,” with all the tremendous consequent
penalties upon him and his posterity; and it is significant in many
ways to observe that a culprit guilty of prostituting the confessional
to seduce his spiritual daughters was to be punished by being made
to take the lowest seat in the choir. This misplaced lenity was more
than carried out in practice. According to Llorente, the records of
the Inquisition show that not ten per cent. of those accused were
convicted; and even when convicted it was not unusual for the convict,
through influences brought to bear on the Inquisitors General,
to obtain a removal of the interdiction of hearing confessions.<a id="FNanchor_1509_1509" href="#Footnote_1509_1509" class="fnanchor">1509</a> In
one case of special atrocity which occurred under the eyes of Llorente
himself, the culprit, in addition to the discipline, deprivation of vote,
and degradation to the lowest seat in the choir (he had been Provincial
of the Capuchins of New Grenada), was condemned to five
years’ imprisonment in a convent of his own order—a most inadequate
penalty for a man who had seduced thirteen nuns in a convent
under his spiritual guardianship.<a id="FNanchor_1510_1510" href="#Footnote_1510_1510" class="fnanchor">1510</a> In the horrible affair of Corella,
which occurred in 1743, it is true that the Abbess, Doña Agueda de
Luna, died under the torture; and her principal accomplice, Fray
Juan de la Vega, after being tortured in his examination, was
declared suspect in the highest degree and was confined in the desert
convent of Duruelo till his death, but in this case the accused were
Molinists, or Illuminati, which of itself rendered them worthy of the
stake, and in addition, besides numerous infanticides, they had
entered into a pact with Satan.<a id="FNanchor_1511_1511" href="#Footnote_1511_1511" class="fnanchor">1511</a></p>

<p>The nunneries, indeed, appear to have suffered especially from this
cause, particularly when their spiritual directors were monks. This
was a complaint of old standing, and the authors of the “Consilium
de Emendanda Ecclesia,” in 1538, proposed to put an end to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">573</span>
scandals thence arising by prohibiting members of the conventual
orders from serving in that capacity, which was to be confided in the
future to the Episcopal Ordinaries.<a id="FNanchor_1512_1512" href="#Footnote_1512_1512" class="fnanchor">1512</a> A more partial cure was that
suggested in 1627 by Urban VIII. when he granted a special Bull
to Christobal de Lobera, Bishop of Cordova, depriving the mendicant
orders of their right to papal jurisdiction, and subjecting them to the
Ordinary of the diocese in order to put a stop, if possible, to crimes
committed by them in the confessional.<a id="FNanchor_1513_1513" href="#Footnote_1513_1513" class="fnanchor">1513</a> These monastic troubles
were by no means confined to Spain. When, as we shall see hereafter,
the Grand Duke, Leopold of Tuscany, undertook in 1774 to
reform the nunneries of his dominions, they had for a century and a
half been the scene of the worst disorders, committed by the regular
clergy who were their spiritual directors, and Leopold found his
principal opposition in the court of Rome itself.<a id="FNanchor_1514_1514" href="#Footnote_1514_1514" class="fnanchor">1514</a> In Provence, the
canons of Pignan made no secret of their domination over the bodies
as well as over the souls of the nuns of the district, so that in a single
year there were sixteen declarations of pregnancy officially made by
the latter, who seemed to consider it as one of the duties of their profession.
As Michelet remarks, this at least diminished the monastic
crime of infanticide, for the children were openly put out to nurse
and were generally adopted by their foster-mothers.<a id="FNanchor_1515_1515" href="#Footnote_1515_1515" class="fnanchor">1515</a></p>

<p>Some statistics, given by Llorente from the archives of the Inquisition,
afford a curious commentary upon the influence of monasticism.
Comparing the number of accusations brought for this offence with
the total census of the secular and regular clergy, he found that one
out of every ten thousand secular priests was charged with it, while
among the monastic orders the proportion was much greater. The
Benedictines, Bernardines, Jeronymites, Premonstratensians, Basilians,
Agonizantes, Theatins, and Oratorians, and the canons regular
of Calatrava, Santiago, Alcantara, Montesa, St. Juan, and of the
Holy Sepulchre showed a proportion of one in every thousand.
Among the Carmelites, Augustinians, Mathurins, the Order of La
Merced, the Dominicans, Franciscans, and Minims of St. Francis
de Paul, there was one in every five hundred: one in four hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">574</span>
among the barefooted orders of the Augustinians, Mathurins, and
Fathers of La Merced; and one in two hundred among the barefooted
Carmelites, the Alcantarians and the Capuchins.<a id="FNanchor_1516_1516" href="#Footnote_1516_1516" class="fnanchor">1516</a> These
results Llorente explains partly by the greater attention paid by
some orders to the duties of the confessional, but chiefly by the differences
in their rules of discipline. Those who, like the secular
priests, had comparative wealth and freedom were able to gratify
their passions without resorting to indulgence so dangerous, while
those whose vows bound them to poverty and asceticism were most
liable to be tempted by the opportunities of the confessional. It
was precisely the orders that were most rigid which produced the
greatest number of culprits. Another significant fact was that the
greater portion of these accusations were brought by nuns, and from
this Llorente seeks to explain the small proportion of cases in which
the accused was found guilty. The inquiries necessary to confession
often appeared to the simple-minded devotee a direct enticement to
sin, and her excited imagination, in dwelling upon them, would lead
her to imagine herself the object of her confessor’s impure desires—a
defence of the system almost as damaging as the facts which it
attempts to extenuate.<a id="FNanchor_1517_1517" href="#Footnote_1517_1517" class="fnanchor">1517</a></p>

<p>Whatever may be Llorente’s opinion as to the comparative innocence
of the secular priesthood, it does not appear to have been shared
by the church. The local ecclesiastical legislation of the seventeenth
century is surcharged with innumerable minute directions as to the
age of the confessor and the form and structure of confessionals; restricting
female penitents, unless dangerously ill, from being heard
except in church and by daylight, and prescribing the relative positions
to be maintained by confessor and penitent.<a id="FNanchor_1518_1518" href="#Footnote_1518_1518" class="fnanchor">1518</a> In the earlier,
though scarce purer, period of the fifteenth century John Myrc contents
himself with simpler rules—</p>

<p class="pnind">and the attention which was now given to the minutest details of
these matters shows how much men’s minds were excited by the subject,
and how, as usual, the church sought palliatives for the evil to
which she dared not apply a radical cure.</p>

<p>A natural result of the effort made to suppress the evil was a refinement
of ingenuity on the part of the evil-doers to escape the result
of their transgressions, and the subtlety of casuists was taxed to the
utmost in defining with precision all the acts and motives which would
render offenders liable to the penalties decreed in the Papal Bulls,
thus giving rise to quite a literature specially devoted to the subject.<a id="FNanchor_1520_1520" href="#Footnote_1520_1520" class="fnanchor">1520</a>
In 1614, the Roman Inquisition, under Paul V., was obliged
formally to declare that priests who used the confessional as a place
of assignation were liable to the decrees, even though not engaged at
the moment in administering the sacrament of penitence;<a id="FNanchor_1521_1521" href="#Footnote_1521_1521" class="fnanchor">1521</a> and in
1665 Alexander VII. felt it necessary to condemn the proposition
that a confessor, while hearing a confession, could give his penitent a
love-letter without incurring the guilt of solicitation.<a id="FNanchor_1522_1522" href="#Footnote_1522_1522" class="fnanchor">1522</a> The mode,
however, which offered the surest escape was for the confessor to
absolve his partner in sin, and thus release her from all obligation to
denounce him,<a id="FNanchor_1523_1523" href="#Footnote_1523_1523" class="fnanchor">1523</a> for such an absolution was good, according to St.
Thomas Aquinas.<a id="FNanchor_1524_1524" href="#Footnote_1524_1524" class="fnanchor">1524</a> This gave the church infinite trouble. It satisfied
the conscience of the woman, for the council of Trent had taken
care to declare that priests in mortal sin did not lose the power of
absolution conferred on them by the Holy Ghost in their ordination,<a id="FNanchor_1525_1525" href="#Footnote_1525_1525" class="fnanchor">1525</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">576</span>
while so vile a prostitution of the sacrament could not but bring the
whole system into contempt. Yet casuists were found to distinguish
between the guilt of him who soothes the conscience of the woman
whom he had seduced by absolving her after the act, in which case
he is not exposed to the penalties of solicitation,<a id="FNanchor_1526_1526" href="#Footnote_1526_1526" class="fnanchor">1526</a> and of him who
promises absolution in advance as a temptation to sin, which brings
him within the scope of the decrees.<a id="FNanchor_1527_1527" href="#Footnote_1527_1527" class="fnanchor">1527</a></p>

<p>The condemnation issued in 1665 by Alexander VII. of the proposition
that absolution under such circumstances relieves the woman
from the obligation of denunciation<a id="FNanchor_1528_1528" href="#Footnote_1528_1528" class="fnanchor">1528</a> shows the extent of the evil and
the boldness of the perpetrators, but did nothing to cure it. A more
effective step had been taken in 1661 by the provincial synod of
Cambray, which was the revival of the ancient rule that no confessor
should have power in such cases to grant absolution to his paramour
except <i>in articulo mortis</i>; a precedent which was followed in 1663
by the congregation of arch-priests of the province of Mechlin.<a id="FNanchor_1529_1529" href="#Footnote_1529_1529" class="fnanchor">1529</a>
This action seems to have aroused considerable opposition and no
little discussion, for, at a convocation of bishops, held at Brussels in
January, 1665, it was the first subject submitted for debate.<a id="FNanchor_1530_1530" href="#Footnote_1530_1530" class="fnanchor">1530</a> The
question, however, remained unsettled, for, although the power to
grant such absolution was specially excepted in all commissions issued
to confessors in the province, the evil continued, and again came up
for discussion at the synod of Namur, in 1698, when the practice was
peremptorily forbidden for the future.<a id="FNanchor_1531_1531" href="#Footnote_1531_1531" class="fnanchor">1531</a> In the province of Besançon
a canon of 1689 declares that although the abuse had been long prohibited,
yet that it continued to flourish; and a formal enunciation
was considered necessary, taking away the power of conferring absolution
in such cases—a regulation which had to be repeated in 1707.<a id="FNanchor_1532_1532" href="#Footnote_1532_1532" class="fnanchor">1532</a>
In 1709 the Cardinal de Noailles, Archbishop of Paris, issued an
order prohibiting it in his diocese, but as late as 1741 Pontas informs
us that such absolutions were valid in all places where they had not
been forbidden by episcopal authority.<a id="FNanchor_1533_1533" href="#Footnote_1533_1533" class="fnanchor">1533</a> This extraordinary confes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">577</span>sion
on such a subject was most discreditable to the church, and in
1741 Benedict XIV. signalized the commencement of his pontificate
by converting these local regulations into a general law by his Bull,
“Sacramentum Pœnitentiæ,” in which he not only endeavored to
sweep away all the refinements by which casuists had so nearly nullified
the decrees of his predecessors, but he devoted a special clause to
the device by which the sacrilegious ministers of Satan rather than of
God absolved their partners in guilt. This he absolutely prohibited
for the future, except <i>in articulo mortis</i> when no other priest could
be had; he took away the power of administering the sacrament of
penitence in such cases, pronounced absolution null and void when
thus given, and punished the attempt to give it by <i>ipso facto</i> excommunication
removable by the papal court alone.<a id="FNanchor_1534_1534" href="#Footnote_1534_1534" class="fnanchor">1534</a> Four years
later, he relaxed somewhat the rigor of these regulations in a manner
which shows how everpresent was the fear of attracting attention to
the frailties of ecclesiastics, for he permitted absolution <i>in articulo
mortis</i> in all cases where another confessor could not be called in
without attracting attention and causing suspicion and scandal, which
was virtually to remove the prohibition.<a id="FNanchor_1535_1535" href="#Footnote_1535_1535" class="fnanchor">1535</a> In the same year he also
renewed the decree of 1633 requiring the Papal Bulls on the subject
to be read at least once a year in the chapters of all the monastic
orders,<a id="FNanchor_1536_1536" href="#Footnote_1536_1536" class="fnanchor">1536</a> who seem to have been the principal offenders in these
matters; doubtless for the reason which Llorente says was usually
alleged as an excuse by culprits—because they had no other
opportunity of sinning.<a id="FNanchor_1537_1537" href="#Footnote_1537_1537" class="fnanchor">1537</a></p>

<p>Energetic as was the legislation of Benedict, it by no means put
an end to the trouble. The year after his Bull appeared, in 1742,
the synod of Namur found it necessary to remind confessors that
they could not absolve women whom they had seduced;<a id="FNanchor_1538_1538" href="#Footnote_1538_1538" class="fnanchor">1538</a> and in 1768
the Bishop of Ypres was obliged to recall to the attention of his
clergy the Bulls of Gregory and of Benedict, and to threaten their
transgressors with excommunication.<a id="FNanchor_1539_1539" href="#Footnote_1539_1539" class="fnanchor">1539</a> The abuse was by no means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">578</span>
confined to Europe, but extended to the missionary stations of the
church. In 1775 the Apostolic Vicar of Cochin China inquired of
Pius VI. whether the Bull of Benedict XIV. applied to the Franciscan
missionaries under his charge, and, if so, whether it could not
be moderated, to which Pius replied affirmatively as to the first question
and negatively as to the second. That the scandal continued
is shown by a pastoral letter of the Apostolic Vicar of Suchuen in
1803.<a id="FNanchor_1540_1540" href="#Footnote_1540_1540" class="fnanchor">1540</a> It is not surprising that St. François de Sales should have
declared that a confessor was to be selected out of ten thousand,
seeing that so few among them were fitted for the function.<a id="FNanchor_1541_1541" href="#Footnote_1541_1541" class="fnanchor">1541</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In considering the slow progress of improvement in the character
of the clergy, we must bear in mind not only the debased material
which required to be reformed, and the prevailing low standard
of sexual morality throughout Europe, but also the prevalence
within the church of the casuistic spirit, which tended to obliterate
the distinctions between right and wrong and to extenuate all offences
against the Decalogue. This spirit received a powerful impulse from
the rising influence of the Company of Jesus, which furnished the
most distinguished casuists and fostered the habit of testing everything
by an artificial standard. If scandal could be averted, if the
immediate temporal interests of the Order or of the church could be
subserved, it mattered little whether morality suffered; and the subtle
dialectics of the schools could always invent a justification for any
line of action which appeared expedient at the moment. We have
already seen how the successive Bulls of reforming pontiffs directed
against the abuses of the confessional were virtually nullified in this
manner; and the same processes were employed to soften the harshness
of the canons which sought to repress the other vices of the
clergy.<a id="FNanchor_1542_1542" href="#Footnote_1542_1542" class="fnanchor">1542</a> To one who examines the works of these skilful dialecticians,
the only wonder is that a church which not only tolerated
but exalted them could retain any respect for virtue or any reverence
for law, human or divine.</p>

<p>When these resources failed, recourse could be had to other means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">579</span>
to avert scandal, as in the case of Father Mena, a priest of the Company
of Jesus, at Salamanca, who persuaded one of his female penitents
that God required her to abandon herself to him. He kept
her in a hermitage conveniently near to the College of Jesuits where
he officiated, and several children were the result of the union, when
the matter became so notorious that the Inquisition interfered and
threw the culprit into its prison at Valladolid. The Company of
Jesus undertook his defence, and on the strength of certificates of
his illness obtained his transfer to their college, where he was to be
watched by officials of the Inquisition. His apparent illness increased,
until a report was spread of his death; an image with a
mask resembling him was interred with all the ceremonies of religion,
and he was secretly conveyed to Genoa, where he was intrusted with
a mission to convert the Jews.<a id="FNanchor_1543_1543" href="#Footnote_1543_1543" class="fnanchor">1543</a></p>

<p>More strenuous exertion, however, was required in the struggle
over the case of Father Girard and la Cadière, which, in 1730 and
1731, convulsed society in Provence. Girard was a Jesuit of high
reputation, who came to Toulon in 1728, where he soon obtained the
spiritual direction of a number of women, among whom he selected
seven to minister to his lusts. One of them, Catharine Cadière, a
girl of 19, was especially distinguished for her exaltation of religious
sensibility, which rendered her eminently fitted for the dangerous
extravagances of Quietism. Under his guidance she speedily had
ecstatic visions of heaven and hell, and was marked as the favorite
of Divine Love by the stigmata which appeared on hands, feet, forehead,
and side. While enjoying the popular veneration as a saint,
it was not difficult for her spiritual guide to persuade her that God
required her submission to him. This continued for some months,
until, convinced that Girard had led her into sin, in place of the
state of perfection to which she aspired, she changed her confessor,
when the matter leaked out, and she brought a formal accusation
against her seducer. At once the Company of Jesus took up the
quarrel, and, as it suited the policy of Cardinal Fleury, the all-powerful
minister, to gratify them, the unfortunate girl had no
chance. The Episcopal courts, in which the case was first brought,
sided with the guilty, and even the secular tribunals, to which the
matter was transferred, were bitterly hostile to her. The accuser
became the accused. She was persecuted, imprisoned, and threat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">580</span>ened
with torture, and in the Parlement of Aix, before which the
case was finally brought, two members actually proposed that she
should be burnt alive, but agreed, in order to secure the support of
others, to accept the milder sentence of strangling after due infliction
of torture, and this verdict was brought before the Parlement for
debate. Despite the social influence of the Jesuits, this atrocity
aroused public opinion throughout Provence and excited tumults
which frightened the friends of Girard, so that when the final vote
was taken only half the members of the Parlement pronounced him
innocent, the other half voting for his condemnation, and he was
saved by the casting vote of the President, Lebret. So strong was
the popular feeling against him that he had to be conveyed away
secretly to escape the vengeance of the mob, and died two years
afterwards in the odor of sanctity, fully upheld by the Company of
Jesus. As for la Cadière, she disappeared from sight, and the fate
of the unfortunate girl is unknown.<a id="FNanchor_1544_1544" href="#Footnote_1544_1544" class="fnanchor">1544</a></p>

THE CHURCH AND THE REVOLUTION.</h2>


<p>If the council of Trent had thus failed utterly in its efforts to
create that which had never existed—purity of morals under the rule
of celibacy—it had at length succeeded in its more important task of
putting an end to the aspirations of the clergy for marriage. With
the anathema for heresy confronting them, few could be found so bold
as openly to dispute the propriety of a law which had been incorporated
into the articles of faith; and the ingenious sophistries and far-fetched
logic of Bellarmine were reverently received and accepted as
incontrovertible. Urbain Grandier might endeavor to quiet the conscience
of his morganatic spouse by writing a treatise to prove the
lawfulness of priestly wedlock, but he took care to keep the manuscript
carefully locked in his desk.<a id="FNanchor_1545_1545" href="#Footnote_1545_1545" class="fnanchor">1545</a> A man of bold and independent
spirit, fortified by unfathomable learning, like Louis Ellies Du Pin,
might secretly favor marriage, and perhaps might contract matri<span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">582</span>mony.<a id="FNanchor_1546_1546" href="#Footnote_1546_1546" class="fnanchor">1546</a>
Du Pin’s great antagonist, Bossuet, might incur a similar
imputation, and be ready to partially yield the point if thereby he
might secure the reconciliation of the hostile churches.<a id="FNanchor_1547_1547" href="#Footnote_1547_1547" class="fnanchor">1547</a> All this,
however, could have no influence on the doctrines and practice of
Catholicism at large, and the principle remained unaltered and
unalterable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yet it was impossible that the critical spirit of inquiry which
marked the eighteenth century, its boldness of unbelief, and its utter
want of faith in God and man, could leave unassailed this monument
of primæval asceticism, while it was so busy in undermining everything
to which the reverence of its predecessors had clung. Accordingly,
the latter half of the century witnessed an active controversy
on the subject. In 1758, a canon of Estampes, named Desforges,
who had been forced to take orders by his family, published a work
in two volumes in which he attempted to prove that marriage was
necessary for all ranks of ecclesiastics. The book attracted attention,
and by order of the Parlement it was burnt, September 30,
1758, by the hangman, and the unlucky author was thrown into the
Bastile. These proceedings were well calculated to give publicity to
the work; it was reprinted at Douay in 1772; a German translation
was published in 1782 at Göttingen and Munster, and an Italian
one, with some omissions, had already appeared in 1770, without an
acknowledged place of publication. The Abbé Villiers undertook to
answer Desforges in a weak little volume, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_583">583</span> “Apologie du Célibat
Chretien,” published in 1762, which consists principally of long
extracts from the Fathers in praise of virginity. Even Italy felt
the movement, and an anonymous work, entitled “Pregiudizi del
Celibato,” appeared in Naples in 1765, and was reprinted in Venice
in 1766. Some more competent champion was necessary to answer
these repeated attacks, and the learned Abate Zaccaria brought his
fertile pen and his inexhaustible erudition to the rescue in his “Storia
Polemica del Celibato Sacro,” which saw the light in 1774, and which
not long afterwards was translated into German. In 1781 appeared
a new aspirant for matrimonial liberty in the Abbé Gaudin, who
issued at Geneva (Lyons) his work entitled “Les inconveniens du
célibat des prêtres,” a treatise of considerable learning and no little
bitterness against the whole structure of sacerdotalism and Roman
supremacy. This was followed, in 1782, by Andreas Forster, in his
“De Cœlibatu Clericorum Dissertatio,” published at Dillingen, and
dedicated to Pius VI., for the purpose of replying to the attacks of
the innovating Catholics.</p>

<p>The latter, indeed, had some hope for the approaching realization
of their demands. The reforms which illustrated the minority of
Ferdinand IV. of Naples excited the priests of Southern Italy to
petition him for the right of marriage, and Serrao, the Jansenist
Bishop of Potenza, does not hesitate to say that the request would
have been granted if the unfriendly relations between the courts of
Rome and Naples had continued much longer.<a id="FNanchor_1548_1548" href="#Footnote_1548_1548" class="fnanchor">1548</a> The Emperor
Joseph II., amid his many fruitless schemes for philosophical reform,
inclined seriously to the notion of permitting marriage to the priesthood
of his dominions. In an edict of 1783 he asserted, incidentally,
that the matter was subject to his control,<a id="FNanchor_1549_1549" href="#Footnote_1549_1549" class="fnanchor">1549</a> and the advocates of clerical
marriage confidently expected that in a very short period they
would see the ancient restrictions swept away by the imperial power.
A mass of controversial essays and dissertations made their appearance
throughout Germany, and the well-known Protestant theologian
Henke took the opportunity of bringing out, in 1783, a new edition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_584">584</span>
of the learned work of Calixtus, “De Conjugio Clericorum,” as the
most efficient aid to the good cause. It is a striking illustration of
the temper of the times to observe that this work, so bitterly opposed
to the orthodox doctrines and practice, is dedicated by Henke to
Archdeacon Anthony Ganoczy, canon of the cathedral church of
Gross-Wardein and apostolic prothonotary. The hope of success
brought out other writers, and the movement made sufficient progress
to cause some hesitation in Rome as to the propriety of yielding to
the pressure.<a id="FNanchor_1550_1550" href="#Footnote_1550_1550" class="fnanchor">1550</a></p>

<p>Zaccaria again entered the lists, and produced, in 1785, his “Nuova
Giustificazione del Celibato Sacro,” in answer to the Abbé Gaudin
and to an anonymous German writer whose work had produced considerable
sensation. To this he was principally moved by a report
that he had himself been converted by the facts and arguments advanced
by the German, an imputation which he indignantly refuted
in three hundred quarto pages.</p>

<p>The half-formed resolutions of Joseph II. led to no result, and the
subject slumbered for a few years until the outbreak of the French
Revolution. At an early period in that great movement, the adversaries
of sacerdotal asceticism bestirred themselves in bringing to
public attention the evils and cruelty of the system. Already, in
1789, a mass of pamphlets appeared urging the abrogation of celibacy.
In 1790 the work of the Abbé Gaudin was reprinted, and
was promptly answered by the prolific Maultrot. Even in Germany
the same spirit again awoke, and an Hungarian priest named Katz
published at Vienna, in 1791, a “Tractatus de conjugio et cœlibatu
clericorum,” in which he argued strongly for a change. In Poland
these doctrines made considerable progress, for in 1801 we find a
little tract issued at Warsaw vehemently arguing against those who
imperil their souls by violating their vows and the laws of the church.<a id="FNanchor_1551_1551" href="#Footnote_1551_1551" class="fnanchor">1551</a>
In England, a Catholic priest distinguished for talents and learning,
Dr. Geddes, published, in 1800, a work in which he denied the
Apostolic origin of celibacy and urged that, at most, it should only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">585</span>
be punished by degradation from the priesthood, without entailing
disgrace. Indeed, he argued that the rule caused more proselytes to
Protestantism than any other cause.<a id="FNanchor_1552_1552" href="#Footnote_1552_1552" class="fnanchor">1552</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During this period it can hardly be supposed that the defiant
immorality which characterized the eighteenth century had been
favorable to the purity of a celibate priesthood. That the church,
indeed, had made but scanty improvement in the character of its
ministers is visible throughout the literature of the age, and I need
only allude to a few instances where efforts at reform revealed the
prevailing corruption.</p>

<p>In France the attacks upon the vow of celibacy, to which allusion
has already been made, seem to have given rise to a spasmodic attempt
to regulate the church. In 1760 an arrêt of the Parlement of Paris
prohibited the organization of religious congregations without express
royal permission, verified by that body. The assembly of the clergy
in Paris in 1766 produced no notable improvement, nor was greater
success obtained when the temporal power intervened in the Edicts
of 1766 and 1767. Further effort apparently was requisite, and in
the Edict of March, 1768, Louis XV. undertook to diminish in some
degree the causes of the more flagrant disorders among the regular
clergy. Men were not to be allowed to take the vows under the age
of 22, nor women under 19; and as the smaller religious houses were
especially notorious for laxness of discipline, all were suppressed
which could not number at least fifteen professed monks or nuns,
except those attached to larger congregations. The ecclesiastical
authorities, moreover, were emphatically commanded to make a thorough
visitation, and to compel the observance of the rules of discipline
of the several orders.<a id="FNanchor_1553_1553" href="#Footnote_1553_1553" class="fnanchor">1553</a> The enforcement of this edict created
no little excitement, and several of the smaller orders narrowly escaped
destruction in their endeavors to evade its provisions. That
these efforts did not succeed in accomplishing their object we may
well believe, even without the testimony of an eye-witness.<a id="FNanchor_1554_1554" href="#Footnote_1554_1554" class="fnanchor">1554</a> As for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_586">586</span>
the secular clergy, when Louis XV. amused himself by ordering the
arrest of all ecclesiastics caught frequenting brothels, the number
of victims in a short time amounted to 296, of whom no less than
100 were priests actively engaged in the service of the altar.<a id="FNanchor_1555_1555" href="#Footnote_1555_1555" class="fnanchor">1555</a></p>

<p>When the Grand-Duke Leopold of Tuscany undertook to reform
the monasteries of his dominions and to put an end, if possible, to
the abuse of the confessional, it led to a long diplomatic correspondence
with the papal curia as to the jurisdiction over such cases.
A public document of the year 1763 had already stated that the
special crime in question had become less frequent, and attributed
this improvement to the exceeding laxity of morals everywhere
prevalent, for few confessors could be so foolish as to attempt seduction
in the confessional when there was so little risk in doing the
same thing elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_1556_1556" href="#Footnote_1556_1556" class="fnanchor">1556</a> Specious as this reasoning might seem, the
facts on which it was based were hardly borne out by the investigations
of Leopold shortly after into the morals of the monastic establishments.
Nothing more scandalous is to be found in the visitations
of the religious houses of England under Morton and Cromwell.
The spiritual directors of the nunneries had converted them virtually
into harems, and such of the sisters as were proof against seduction
armed with the powers of confession and absolution suffered every
species of persecution. It was rare for them to venture on complaint,
but when they did so they received no attention from their ecclesiastical
superiors, and only the protection of the grand-ducal authority
at length emboldened them to reveal the truth. The prioress of S.
Caterina di Pistoia declared that, with three or four exceptions, all
the monks and confessors with whom she had met in her long career
were alike; that they treated the nuns as wives, and taught them
that God had made man for woman and woman for man; and that
the visitations of the bishops amounted to naught, even though they
were aware of what occurred, for the mouths of the victims were
sealed by the dread of excommunication threatened by their spiritual
directors.<a id="FNanchor_1557_1557" href="#Footnote_1557_1557" class="fnanchor">1557</a> When it is considered that the convents thus converted
into dens of prostitution were the favorite schools to which the girls
of the higher classes were sent for training and education, it can
readily be imagined what were the moral influences thence radiating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_587">587</span>
throughout society at large, and we can appreciate the argument
above referred to, as to the ease with which the clergy could procure
sexual indulgence without recourse to the confessional. Leopold’s
chief assistant in this struggle was Scipione de’ Ricci, Bishop of
Pistoia and Prato, whose experiences in the investigation caused him
to induce the council of Pistoia, in 1786, to declare the duties of the
confessional wholly incompatible with the monastic state, and, in
view of the improbability of any permanent reform, to propose the
abolition of the monastic orders by restricting vows to the duration
of a twelvemonth<a id="FNanchor_1558_1558" href="#Footnote_1558_1558" class="fnanchor">1558</a>—propositions which were not approved by the
congregation of Tuscan prelates held at Florence in 1787, and which
were scornfully condemned by Rome.<a id="FNanchor_1559_1559" href="#Footnote_1559_1559" class="fnanchor">1559</a> Leopold, however, sought to
palliate the evil by raising to the age of 24 the minimum limit for
taking the vows, which the council of Trent had fixed at 16, but
the benefit of this salutary measure was neutralized by the ease with
which parents desiring to get rid of their children could place them
in the institutions of the neighboring states, such as Lucca and
Modena.<a id="FNanchor_1560_1560" href="#Footnote_1560_1560" class="fnanchor">1560</a></p>

<p>Rome itself was no better than its dependent provinces, despite
the high personal character of some of the pontiffs. When the too
early death of Clement XIV., in 1774, cut short the hopes which
had been excited by his enlightened rule, St. Alphonso Liguori
addressed to the conclave assembled for the election of his successor
a letter urging them to make such a choice as would afford reasonable
prospect of accomplishing the much-needed reform. The saint did
not hesitate to characterize the discipline of the secular clergy as
most grievously lax, and to proclaim that a general reform of the
ecclesiastical body was the only way to remove the fearful corruption
of the morals of the laity.<a id="FNanchor_1561_1561" href="#Footnote_1561_1561" class="fnanchor">1561</a> When we hear, about this time, of two
Carmelite convents at Rome, one male and the other female, which
had to be pulled down because underground passages had been established
between them, by means of which the monks and nuns lived
in indiscriminate licentiousness, and when we read the scandalous
stories which were current in Roman society about prelates high in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_588">588</span>
the church, we can readily appreciate the denunciations of St. Alphonso.<a id="FNanchor_1562_1562" href="#Footnote_1562_1562" class="fnanchor">1562</a>
A curious glimpse at the interior of conventual life is
furnished by a manual for Inquisitors, written about this period by
an official of the Holy Office of Rome. In a chapter on nuns he
describes the scandals which often cause them to fall within the jurisdiction
of the Inquisition, and prescribes the course to be pursued
with regard to the several offences. Among those who were forced
to take the veil, despair frequently led to the denial of God, of
heaven, and of hell; feminine enmity caused accusations of sorcery
and witchcraft, which threw not only the nunneries, but whole cities,
into confusion; vain-glory of sanctity suggested pretended revelations
and visions; and these latter were also not infrequently caused by
licentiousness, for in these utterances were sometimes taught doctrines
utterly subversive of morality, of which Godless confessors took advantage
to teach their spiritual daughters that there was no sin in
sexual intercourse. As in Spain, it was the practice of the Roman
Inquisition to treat the offenders mildly, partly in consideration of
the temptations to which they were exposed, and partly to avoid
scandal.<a id="FNanchor_1563_1563" href="#Footnote_1563_1563" class="fnanchor">1563</a> The contaminating influence on society at large, emanating
from a church so incurably corrupted, was vastly heightened
by the overgrown numbers of the clerical body. In 1775, for example,
a census of the <i>terra-firma</i> provinces of Venice showed in
that narrow territory no less than 45,773 priests, or one to every
fifty inhabitants, while in the kingdom of Naples, exclusive of Sicily,
there were, in 1769, one to every seventy-six.<a id="FNanchor_1564_1564" href="#Footnote_1564_1564" class="fnanchor">1564</a> Such overcrowding
as this was not only in itself an efficient cause of disorder, but
intensified incalculably the power of infection.</p>

<p>The virtues of the clergy, therefore, could offer but a feeble barrier
to the spirit of innovation when the passions of the French
Revolution were brought to bear upon the immunities and distinctive
laws of the church. The attack commenced on that which had been
the strength, but which was now the weakness, of the ecclesiastical
establishment. As early as the 10th of August, 1789, preliminary
steps were taken in the National Assembly to appropriate the property
of the church to meet the fearful deficit which had been the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_589">589</span>
efficient cause of calling together the high council of the nation.
This property was estimated as covering one-fifth of the surface of
France, yielding with the tithes an annual revenue of three hundred
millions of francs. So vast an amount of wealth, perverted for the
most part from its legitimate purposes, offered an irresistible temptation
to desperate financiers, and yet it was a prelate who made the
first direct attack upon it. On the 10th of October, 1789, Talleyrand,
then Bishop of Autun, introduced a motion to the effect that
it should be devoted to the national wants, subject to the proper and
necessary expenses for public worship; and on the 2d of November
the measure was adopted by a vote of 568 to 346. This settled the
principle, though the details of a transaction of such magnitude were
only perfected by successive acts during the two following years. One
of the earliest results was the secularization of those ecclesiastics
whose labors did not entitle them to support, a preliminary necessary
to the intended appropriation of their princely revenues. This was
accomplished by an act of February 13th, 1790, by which the religious
orders were suppressed, monastic vows were declared void,
and a moderate annuity accorded to the unfortunates thus turned
adrift upon the world.</p>

<p>The great body of the parochial clergy, patriotic in their aspirations,
and suffering from the abuses of power, had hailed the advent
of the Revolution with joy; and their assistance had been invaluable
in rendering the Tiers-État supreme in the National Assembly. These
measures, however, assailing their dearest interests and privileges,
aroused them to a sense of the true tendency of the movement to
which they had contributed so powerfully. A breach was inevitable
between them and the partisans of progress. Every forward step
embittered the quarrel. It was impossible for the one party to stay
its course, or for the other to assent to acts which daily became more
menacing and revolutionary. Forced, therefore, into the position of
reactionaries, the clergy ere long became objects of suspicion and
soon after of persecution. The progressives devised a test-oath,
obligatory on all ecclesiastics, which should divide those who were
loyal to the Revolution from the contumacious, and lists were kept
of both classes.<a id="FNanchor_1565_1565" href="#Footnote_1565_1565" class="fnanchor">1565</a> Harmless as the oath was in appearance, when it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_590">590</span>
was tendered, in December, 1790, five-sixths of the clergy throughout
the kingdom refused it. Those who yielded to the pressure were
termed <i>assermentés</i>, the recusants <i>insermentés</i> or <i>réfractaires</i>, and
the latter, of course, at once became the determined opponents of
the new régime, the more dangerous because they were the only
influential partisans of reaction belonging to the people. To their
efforts were attributed the insurrections which in La Vendée and
elsewhere threatened the most fearful dangers. They were accordingly
exposed to severe legislation. A decree of November 29, 1791,
deprived them of their stipends and suspended their functions; another
of May 27, 1792, authorized the local authorities to exile them
on the simple denunciation of twenty citizens. Under the Terror
their persons were exposed to flagrant cruelties, and a <i>prêtre réfractaire</i>
was generally regarded, <i>ipso facto</i>, as an enemy to the Republic.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, sacerdotal marriage came to be looked
upon as a powerful lever to disarm or overthrow the hostility of the
church, and also as a test of loyalty or disloyalty. Yet the steps by
which this conclusion was reached were very gradual. In the early
stages of the Revolution, while it was still fondly deemed that the
existing institutions of France could be purified and preserved, the
National Assembly was assailed with petitions asking that the privilege
of marriage should be extended to the clergy.<a id="FNanchor_1566_1566" href="#Footnote_1566_1566" class="fnanchor">1566</a> These met with
no response, even after the suppression of the monastic orders. As
late as September, 1790, when the Abbé Professor Cournand, of the
Collège de France, made a motion in favor of sacerdotal marriage in
the assembly of the district of St. Etienne du Mont in Paris, the
question, after considerable debate, was laid aside as beyond the competence
of that body. It was not until September 3d, 1791, that
Mirabeau introduced into the Assembly a decree providing that no
profession or vocation should debar a citizen from marriage or be
considered as incompatible with marriage, and forbidding the public
officials and notaries from refusing to ratify any marriage contract
on such pretext. Though no allusion was made in this to ecclesiastics,
its object was evident, and was so admitted in the eloquent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">591</span>
speech with which he urged its adoption—a speech which contained
a very telling résumé of the arguments in favor of priestly marriage,
but which, in its glowing anticipations of the benefits to be expected
from the measure, affords a somewhat lamentable contrast to the
meagreness of the realization.<a id="FNanchor_1567_1567" href="#Footnote_1567_1567" class="fnanchor">1567</a> The principle, when once established,
was considered of sufficient importance to deserve recognition in the
Constitution of September, 1791, a section in the preamble of which
declares that the law does not recognize religious vows or any engagements
contrary to the rights of nature or to the constitution,<a id="FNanchor_1568_1568" href="#Footnote_1568_1568" class="fnanchor">1568</a>
and this was followed, as Mirabeau had proposed, by a decree of
September 20, 1791, which, in enumerating the obstacles to marriage,
does not allude to monastic vows or holy orders.</p>

<p>Professor Cournand was probably the first man of position and
character to take advantage of the privilege thus permitted, and his
example was followed by many ecclesiastics who had won an honorable
place in the church, in literature, and in science. Among them
may be mentioned the Abbé Gaudin of the Oratoire, the author of
a work already alluded to on the evils of celibacy, who in 1792 represented
La Vendée in the Legislative Assembly, and who in 1805
did not hesitate to publish a little volume entitled “Avis à mon fils,
âgé de sept ans”—although, in the preface to his work in 1781, he
had described himself as long past the age of the passions. Even
bishops yielded to the temptation. Loménie, coadjutor of his uncle
the Archbishop of Sens, Torné Bishop of Bourges, Massieu of Beauvais,
and Lindet of Evreux were publicly married. Many nuptials
of this kind were celebrated with an air of defiance. Pastors announced
their approaching weddings to their flocks in florid rhetoric,
as though assured of finding sympathy for the assertion of the triumph
of nature over the tyranny of man. Others presented themselves
with their brides at the bar of the National Convention, as
though to demonstrate that they were good citizens, who had thrown
off all reverence for the obsolete traditions of the past.</p>

<p>A nation maddened and torn by the extremes of hope, of rage,
and of terror, which met the triumphal march of three hundred and
fifty thousand hostile bayonets with the heads of its king and queen,
which blazoned forth to Europe its irrevocable breach with the past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">592</span>
by instituting festivals in honor of a new Supreme Being and parading
a courtesan through the streets of Paris as the Goddess of
Reason, was not likely to employ much tenderness in coercing its
internal enemies; and chief among these it finally numbered the
ministers of religion. To them it soon applied the marriage test.
To marry was to acknowledge the supremacy of the civil authority,
and to sunder allegiance to foreign domination; celibacy was at the
least a tacit adherence to the enemy, and a mute protest against the
new régime. Matrimony, therefore, rose into importance as at once
a test and a pledge, and every effort was made to encourage it.
Among the records of the revolutionary tribunal is the trial of
Mahue, Curé of S. Sulpice, Aug. 13, 1793, accused of having
written a pamphlet against priestly marriage, and he was only acquitted
on the ground that his crime had been committed prior to
the adoption of the law of July 19, 1793.<a id="FNanchor_1569_1569" href="#Footnote_1569_1569" class="fnanchor">1569</a> A decree of November
19, 1793, relieved from exile or imprisonment all priests who could
show that their banns had been published, and when, soon afterwards,
at the height of the popular frenzy, the Convention sent its deputies
throughout France with instructions to crush out every vestige of
the dreaded reaction, those emissaries made celibacy the object of
their especial attacks. Thus, in the Department of the Meuse,
deputy De la Croix announced that all priests who were not married
should be placed under surveillance; while in Savoy the harsh
measures taken against the clergy were modified in favor of those
who married by permitting them to remain under surveillance. One
zealous deputy ordered a pastor to be imprisoned until he could find
a wife, and another released a canon from jail on his pledging himself
to marry. Many of those thus forced into matrimony were
decrepit with years, and chose brides whose age secured them from
all suspicions of yielding to the temptations of the flesh. Such was
the venerable Martin of Marseilles, who, after seeing his bishop and
two priests, his intimate friends, led to the scaffold, took, at the age
of 76, a wife nearly 60 years old. As an unfortunate ecclesiastic,
who had thus succeeded in weathering the storm, fairly expressed it,
in defending himself against the reproaches of a returned emigré
bishop, he took a wife to serve as a lightning rod. These unwilling
bridegrooms not infrequently deposited with a notary or a trusty
friend a protest against the violence to which they had yielded, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_593">593</span>
a declaration that their relations with their wives should be merely
those of brother and sister.</p>

<p>Yet in this curious persecution the officials only obeyed the voice
of the excited people. The press, the stage, all the organs of public
opinion, were unanimous in warring with celibacy, ridiculing it as a
fanatical remnant of superstition, and denouncing it as a crime
against the state. The popular societies were especially vehement
in promulgating these ideas. The <i>Congrès fraternel</i> of Ausch, in
September, 1793, ordered the local clubs to enlighten the benighted
minds of the populace on the subject, and to exclude from membership
all priests who should not marry within six months. A petition
to the National Assembly from the republicans of Auxerre demanded
that all ecclesiastics who persisted in remaining single should be
banished; while a more truculent address from Condom urged imperiously
that celibacy should be declared a capital crime, and that
the death-penalty should be enforced with relentless severity. In
times so terrible, when suspicion was conviction and conviction
death, and when such were the views of those who swayed public
affairs, it is not to be wondered at if many pious churchmen, unambitious
of the crown of martyrdom, thought matrimony preferable
to the guillotine or the noyade.</p>

<p>Indeed, the only source of surprise is that so few were found to
betray their convictions. In the vast body of the Gallican church it
is estimated that only about 2000 marriages of men in orders took
place, after the reign of terror had rendered it a measure of safety.
In addition to this, about 500 nuns were also married; and though
this proportion is larger, it is still singularly small when we consider
that these poor creatures, utterly unfitted by habit or education to
take care of themselves, were suddenly ejected from their peaceful
retreats, and cast upon a world which was raging in convulsions so
terrible.<a id="FNanchor_1570_1570" href="#Footnote_1570_1570" class="fnanchor">1570</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_594">594</span></p>

<p>This is doubtless attributable to the steadfast resistance which the
better part of the clergy made to the innovation, in spite of the
danger of withstanding the popular frenzy, and in disregard of the
laws which denounced such opposition. Even the <i>assermentés</i>, who
had pledged themselves to the Revolution by taking the oath of
allegiance, were mostly unfavorable to the abrogation of celibacy,
and the position thus maintained by the clergy gave tone to such of
the people as retained enough of devout feeling still to frequent the
churches and partake of the mysteries of religion. The existence of
an active and determined opposition is revealed by an act of August
16th, 1792, guaranteeing the salaries of all married priests, thus
showing that, in some places at least, their stipends had been withheld.
Many pastors, indeed, were driven from their parishes by
their congregations, in consequence of marriage, to put an end to
which a decree of September 17th, 1793, ordered the communes to
continue payment of salaries in all such cases of ejection.</p>

<p>There were not wanting courageous ecclesiastics who opposed the
innovation by every means in their power. Although Gobel, Bishop
of Paris, a creature of the Revolution, favored the marriages of his
clergy, a portion of his curates openly and vigorously denounced
them, and Gratien, Archbishop of Rouen, addressed to him a severe
reproach for his criminal weakness. The same Gratien excommunicated
one of his priests for marrying, and published, July 24th, 1792,
an instruction directed especially against such unions. For this he
was thrown into prison, where he was long confined. Fauchet, of
Bayeux, for the same offence, was reported to the Convention, but
was fortunate enough to elude the consequences. Philibert, of Sedan,
issued, January 20th, 1793, a pastoral in which he more cautiously
argued against the practice, and, after a long persecution, he was
lucky to escape with a decree of costs against him. Pastorals to the
same effect were also promulgated by Clément of Versailles, Héraudin
of Châteauroux, Sanadon of Oléron, Suzor of Tours, and others.</p>

<p>The Convention was not disposed to tolerate proceedings such as
these. To put a stop to them, it adopted, July 19th, 1793, a law
punishing with deprivation and exile all bishops who interfered in
any way with the marriage of their clergy. For a while this appears
to have put a stop to open opposition, but when the reign of terror
was past, and the Catholics saw a prospect of reorganizing the distracted
church, one of their earliest efforts was directed to the restoration
of celibacy. On the 15th of March, 1795, some <i>assermentés</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_595">595</span>
bishops, members of the Convention, issued from Paris an encyclical
letter to the faithful, in which they denounced sacerdotal marriage in
the strongest terms. Those who entered into such unions were declared
unworthy of confidence; the fearful constraint under which
they had sought refuge in matrimony was pronounced to be no justification,
and even renunciation of their wives was not admitted as
entitling them to absolution for the one unpardonable sin.<a id="FNanchor_1571_1571" href="#Footnote_1571_1571" class="fnanchor">1571</a> In a
second letter, issued December 15th of the same year, this denunciation
was repeated in even stronger terms.</p>

<p>In these manifestoes the bishops did not speak by authority. They
could not threaten or command, for they were acting beyond or in
opposition to the law. With the progress of reaction they became
bolder. In 1797 the church ventured to hold a national council, in
which it forbade the nuptial benediction to those who were in orders
or were bound by monastic vows, thus reducing their marriages to
the mere civil contract, and depriving them of all the sanction of
religion. The local synods which, encouraged by the fall of the
Directory, were held in 1800, adopted these principles as a matter of
course, and took measures to enforce them. That of Bourges even
prohibited the churching of women who were wives of ecclesiastics.</p>

<p>This condemnation of the married clergy carried despair and desolation
into the households of those who had offended, and upon whom
the door of reconciliation was so sternly closed. Grégoire of Blois,
a leading actor in all these scenes, records the innumerable appeals
received from the unfortunates, who, torn by remorse and thus repudiated
by the church, begged in vain for the mercy which was incompatible
with the respect due to the ancient and inviolable canons.</p>

<p>All this, however, was merely local action. The Gallican church
had not yet been reunited to Rome. In reconstructing a system of
social order, Napoleon speedily recognized the necessity of religion
in the state, and, despite the opposition of those who still believed
in the Republic, the Concordat of 1801 restored France to its place
in the hierarchy of Latin Christianity. There is nothing in the
Concordat interfering with the right of the priest, as a citizen, to
contract marriage; but as, in all affairs purely ecclesiastical, the
internal regulation and discipline of the church were necessarily left
to itself, the rights of the priest, as a priest, became of course subject
to the received rules of the church, which could thus refuse the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_596">596</span>
nuptial benediction, and suspend the functions of any one contravening
its canons. In consequence of the power thus restored, when
the question soon after arose as to the legality of sacerdotal marriages
contracted during the troubles, the Cardinal-legate Caprara issued
rescripts to those whose unions were anterior to the Concordat, depriving
them of their priestly character, reducing them to the rank
of laymen, and empowering the proper officials to absolve them and
remarry them to the wives whom they had so irregularly wedded.
This created a strong feeling of indignation among the prelates who
had carried the tabernacle through the wilderness, and who, while
opposing such marriages most strenuously, regarded this intervention
of papal authority as a direct assault upon the liberties of the Gallican
church. Their time was past, however, and their denunciations
of this duplication of the sacrament were of no avail. Yet the legality
of such marriages, and the unimpaired right of priests to contract
them, were asserted and proved by Portalis, in his masterly speech
of April 15th, 1802, before the Corps Législatif, advocating the
adoption of the Concordat as a law, although he admitted that the
duties of the priesthood and the feeling of the people rendered sacerdotal
celibacy desirable.<a id="FNanchor_1572_1572" href="#Footnote_1572_1572" class="fnanchor">1572</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Notwithstanding the authority thus restored to the church, and
the certainty of ecclesiastical penalties following such infraction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_597">597</span>
the Tridentine articles of faith, the practice which had been introduced
could not be immediately eradicated. Priests were constantly
contracting marriage, and the question gave considerable trouble to
the government, which hesitated for some time as to the policy to be
pursued. Portalis, in 1802, as we have seen, declared the full legality
of such marriages, and the unimpaired right of ecclesiastics to contract
them; and the provisions of the code respecting marriage,
adopted in 1803, make no allusions to vows or religious engagements
as causing incapacity.<a id="FNanchor_1573_1573" href="#Footnote_1573_1573" class="fnanchor">1573</a> Yet in 1805, when Daviaux, Archbishop of
Bordeaux, opposed the application of a priest named Boisset to the
civil authorities for a marriage contract, Portalis, then minister of
religious affairs, on being appealed to, replied that the government
would not allow its officers to register such contracts. The local administrations
sometimes assented to such applications and sometimes
referred them to the central authority, until at length, in 1807, a
definite conclusion was promulgated. This was to the effect that
although the civil law was silent as regards such marriages, yet they
were condemned by public opinion. The government considered
them fraught with danger to the peace of families, as the powerful
influence of the pastor could be perverted to evil purposes, and, if
seduction could be followed by marriage, that influence would be
liable to great abuse. The emperor therefore declared that he could
not tolerate marriage on the part of those who had exercised priestly
functions since the date of the Concordat. As for those who had
abandoned the ministry previous to that period and had not since
resumed it, he left them to their own consciences. Thus, in practice,
although marriage was regarded as purely a civil institution, a limitation
was introduced which was not authorized by the code, which
rested solely upon the authority of the emperor, and which, far from
indicating respect to the church, was a flagrant insult. As Napoleon
withdrew himself more and more from the principles of the new order
of things, we find him disposed to take even stronger ground in opposition
to the civil privileges accorded to the priesthood by the Concordat.
The question of sacerdotal marriage continued to present
itself under perplexing shapes, and at length the emperor, on the
eve of his downfall, perhaps with a view to propitiate the sacerdotal
power, proposed to apply to married priests the penalty imposed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_598">598</span>
the law on bigamy.<a id="FNanchor_1574_1574" href="#Footnote_1574_1574" class="fnanchor">1574</a> It was too late, however; the empire was
rapidly vanishing, and these suggestions were soon forgotten in the
hurrying march of events.<a id="FNanchor_1575_1575" href="#Footnote_1575_1575" class="fnanchor">1575</a></p>

THE CHURCH OF TO-DAY.</h2>


<p>The question of sacerdotal marriage was left in France, on the
collapse of the empire, in a curiously unsettled condition, giving rise
to very remarkable contradictions in the judicial decisions which since
then have from time to time been rendered by the tribunals as cases
were brought before them.</p>

<p>Under the Restoration, a priest named Martin, an old <i>réfractaire</i>
of 1792, committed the imprudence of marrying in 1815. Not long
after he died without issue. His relatives contested the succession
with the widow, and in 1817 the inferior court decided in her favor.
The next year the court of appeals reversed the judgment on the
ground that sacerdotal marriage had only been sanctioned indirectly
by the legislation of the Revolution, and that the Charter of 1814
(Art. 6) had restored Catholicism as the religion of the state. In
1821, however, the final decision of the court of cassation settled
the question in favor of the widow, thus legalizing such unions, for
the incontrovertible reason that the code did not recognize vows or
holy orders as causes incapacitating for marriage.<a id="FNanchor_1576_1576" href="#Footnote_1576_1576" class="fnanchor">1576</a></p>

<p>Even yet, however, the matter was not held to be finally disposed of.
In 1828, Louis Thérèse Saturnin Dumonteil, a priest of Paris, who
desired to contract marriage, failed to obtain from the courts the
customary assistance required by the law to set aside the refusal of
his parents, who declined their assent to his projected union. The
case was argued in all its bearings on civil and ecclesiastical law, and
he found the tribunals resolutely opposed to him. When the Revolution
of July unsettled the public mind with visions of the revival
of the principles of ’89, Dumonteil endeavored to carry out his pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_600">600</span>ject.
The lower court decided in his favor, March 26, 1831, but
the higher courts reversed the decision and pronounced definitely
that priests could not contract civil marriage,<a id="FNanchor_1577_1577" href="#Footnote_1577_1577" class="fnanchor">1577</a> and this in spite of
the Charter of 1830, which simply affirmed Catholicism to be the
religion of the majority of Frenchmen, while that of 1814 had
declared it to be the religion of the state.</p>

<p>This curiously vexed question seems incapable of positive solution.
The case of Dumonteil apparently discouraged aspirants for clerical
marriage during the next thirty years, for I have met with no
allusions to any attempt in that direction until 1861. In that year
M. de Brou-Laurière, a priest already debarred from his sacred functions,
engaged himself in marriage with Mdlle. Elizabeth Fressanges,
of Deuville near Périgueux. On calling upon the mayor of the village
to perform the ceremony and register the contract, that functionary
refused to act. He was supported by the public authorities,
and the expectant bridegroom was obliged to appeal to the tribunals to
obtain his rights. The question was warmly contested and thoroughly
argued, and it was not until a year had elapsed that the court of Périgueux
rendered a decision ordering the mayor to perform his functions
and to marry the patient couple. The case was then carried to the
superior court at Bordeaux, which reversed the previous decision.</p>

<p>Again, in 1864, in the case of the Abbé Chataigneu, the court of
Angoulême decided that a priest was, under the law of France, not
competent to contract civil marriage.<a id="FNanchor_1578_1578" href="#Footnote_1578_1578" class="fnanchor">1578</a> On the other hand, in 1870,
the court of Algiers, in the case of a M. Q——, delivered an elaborate
decision to the effect that in France there is no law forbidding
the civil marriage of priests.<a id="FNanchor_1579_1579" href="#Footnote_1579_1579" class="fnanchor">1579</a> Yet in 1878 the court of cassation
confirmed a decision of the court of Rennes, pronouncing null and
void the marriage of a priest, at the instance of his nephew and niece,
to whom he had bequeathed his property by a will anterior to the
marriage. When M. Loyson (Père Hyacinthe) married Mrs. Merriman,
in 1872, the ceremony was performed in London, at the office
of the Registrar of Marriages, and M. Loyson gave as the reason of
his seeking a foreign land the refusal of the French officials to con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_601">601</span>firm
the civil ceremony. So the Abbé Chavard, vicar at Marseilles,
in 1874, went to Geneva for the same purpose, where he continued
his priestly functions; and this leads me to regard as exceedingly
improbable a recent statement in the daily journals that priestly
marriages occur in France at the rate of twenty or thirty a year.
In fact, so lately as September, 1883, there was before the courts
a case which shows how uncertain is the question still in France. A
certain Abbé Junqua was expelled from the church and was condemned
to three months’ imprisonment for continuing to wear the
priestly robes. He subsequently married and engaged in trade, when
he failed, and his wife sought to secure her dowry from the bankrupt
assets, but was resisted on the ground that her marriage was illegal
under the Concordat, although the church had itself deprived the
husband of his ecclesiastical character.</p>

<p>In Switzerland I have met with two or three cases of such marriages,
but they have no special significance. In one of them, occurring
in Lucerne some thirty years ago, the priest left the church in
order to marry, and lived with his wife until her death, in 1880, when
he permitted her to be buried as a Catholic, and had the mortification
of seeing her name entered on the register, publicly exposed in
the parish church, as an unmarried woman.</p>

<p>In Wiesbaden, in 1821, a priest named Koch, with the permission
of the authorities, abandoned the priesthood and applied to the curé
of the place to marry him, when, meeting with a refusal, he had the
ceremony performed by a Protestant pastor, and was promptly excommunicated
by the Vicar of Ratisbon. Not deterred by this, in
1828 a hundred and eighty priests of Baden petitioned the secular
power for permission to marry, and the Chamber of Deputies showed
a disposition to grant the request. This effort was imitated in 1831
by the Catholic clergy of Silesia, but the movement was repressed
by the Prussian government; and in 1833, at Trèves, a clerical
association was formed to carry out the same object.<a id="FNanchor_1580_1580" href="#Footnote_1580_1580" class="fnanchor">1580</a> These efforts
brought forth from Gregory XVI. an encyclical letter, in which he
urged the faithful to stand by the canons, and severely condemned
the weakness of some prelates who were disposed to yield.<a id="FNanchor_1581_1581" href="#Footnote_1581_1581" class="fnanchor">1581</a> Some
similar movements in Austria in the next decade led Pius IX., almost
immediately after his accession to the papal chair, in his encyclical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_602">602</span>
letter of November 9th, 1846, to condemn the foul conspiracy against
celibacy which was favored by ecclesiastics plunged in sensuality and
forgetful of their own dignity.<a id="FNanchor_1582_1582" href="#Footnote_1582_1582" class="fnanchor">1582</a> In 1851, moreover, he took especial
pains to stigmatize a work, published in Lima by Francisco de Paula
in 1848, entitled “Defensa de la Autoridad de los Gobiernos,” which
impiously sought to decentralize the church, and which took strong
grounds against enforced celibacy.<a id="FNanchor_1583_1583" href="#Footnote_1583_1583" class="fnanchor">1583</a></p>

<p>How immovable, indeed, is the position of the hierarchy on this
matter is shown by the case of Panzini. Panzini is, or was, a
Capuchin monk who, in 1854, conceived the idea that the greater
part of the evils under which the establishment labors are the result
of celibacy and its attendant immorality. He addressed to the pope
an anonymous memorial urging him to submit the question to the
bishops then assembled in Rome, and followed this with two similar
subsequent applications. Finally, in the troubles of 1859, anticipating
the assembling of a European congress, he resolved to print
an essay on the subject, addressed to all the bishops of the church,
thinking that the congress would afford him an opportunity of reaching
them. The printer to whom he confided his manuscript promptly
placed the dangerous matter in the hands of Cardinal Antonelli, when
Panzini was at once thrown into prison and delivered to the Inquisition.
After a trial which lasted six months, he was condemned to
twelve years’ incarceration and perpetual suspension from the sacerdotal
functions which were his only source of livelihood. After two
years of his sentence had expired, he was released at the instance of
the Italian government, and in 1865 he published his essay, rewritten
from memory, under the title of “Pubblica Confessione di
un Prigioniero dell’ Inquisizione Romana ed origine dei mali della
Chiesa Cattolica.”</p>

<p>Now, Panzini’s persecution arose solely from his affirming that
enforced celibacy is impolitic and unnatural. He professed unbounded
reverence for the church in all matters of faith, and claimed
that the point at issue was merely one of discipline on which the
church might make a mistake. Even here, however, he was careful
to declare his measureless admiration for voluntary asceticism. Virginity
he believed to be immensely superior to matrimony, and he
anathematized as cheerfully as the council of Trent could wish all
who should proclaim the contrary. Even monasticism he defended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_603">603</span>
as a state of perfection recommended by Christ. His sole objective
point was the rigidity of the law which renders the single state indispensable
to all ecclesiastics, and he essayed to prove that this is in
direct antagonism to all the general principles of Catholic theology,
that the purity which is its pretext is impossible to enforce, and that
the effort itself is most disastrous to the church and to the faithful.
The authorities were not disposed to consider that these opinions
were an allowable dissidence on matters of policy, and they hastened
to brand them as heretical. In the sentence passed upon Panzini
the Inquisition took occasion to stigmatize as heresy the assertion
that enforced celibacy is contrary to nature, that it is a stumbling-block
and the cause of perpetual transgression.<a id="FNanchor_1584_1584" href="#Footnote_1584_1584" class="fnanchor">1584</a> That this theory
was enforced in practice so long as the church could control the secular
power is shown in the case of an Italian priest who, preferring
to sanctify love by marriage rather than to indulge in illicit intrigue,
married and fled with his bride to Africa, seeking among the Infidel
the liberty denied him in Christendom. Three children blessed his
union, but the unresting vigilance of the church discovered his
retreat, when, with the aid of the French consulate, he was seized,
carried back to Naples, and thrown into prison to repent indefinitely
over his errors.<a id="FNanchor_1585_1585" href="#Footnote_1585_1585" class="fnanchor">1585</a></p>

<p>There evidently could be no reasonable ground for expecting a
change of policy in this respect on the part of the Roman curia, and
this was recognized in 1866 by some Catholic priests of Hungary,
who desiring liberty of marriage, and seeing the futility of anticipating
it at the hands of their superiors, united in petitioning the
National Diet for the requisite permission. Yet in spite of the extravagance
of supposing that a body which, since the Council of
Trent, has become so thoroughly centralized as the church, would
listen to the wishes of its lower classes, there were not wanting those
who imagined that the Council of the Vatican in 1870 would adopt
the discipline of the Eastern Church and permit marriage to the inferior
orders. Any such expectations were destined to be disappointed
as soon as the preliminary machinery of the council became
known. A <i>congregazione centrale</i> was appointed by Pius IX. in
advance, consisting exclusively of cardinals connected with the Inquisition,
and to this body was delegated the sole determination of
the matters to be submitted to the council for discussion. Under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_604">604</span>
this congregazione, and presided over by its members, were five <i>consulte</i>,
to act as sub-committees on the subjects respectively confided
to their deliberations. The consulta on faith and dogma was under
the presidency of Cardinal Bilio, notorious as the compiler of the
Syllabus of December, 1864; and that on canons and discipline was
committed to Cardinal Catarini, whose whole career had been passed
in the Inquisition, and who had acquired a sinister fame by his
rigorous punishment of all attempts at reform. If, as the church
asserts, the proceedings of general councils are under the immediate
operation of the Holy Ghost, it will be seen what reverent care was
observed to keep Him in due subjection, and to spare the church the
scandal of being brought, by thoughtless innovators, into opposition
with Him.</p>

<p>As the destined outcome of the council was simply the dogma of
papal infallibility, the hopes of the anti-celibatarians were transferred
to the schism caused by that dogma, and known as that of the Old
Catholics. In 1875, a Dean Suczinsky married the Baroness
Gazewaska, and joined the schismatics, when the Prussian government
decided to protect him in the enjoyment of his temporalities,
and his new brethren agreed to receive him, and thus committed
themselves on the question of celibacy—a decision confirmed in 1878
by the Synod of Bonn, which decreed, by a vote of 75 against 22,
that the prohibition of the canons is not an obstacle to the marriage
of ecclesiastics, or to the cure of souls by married priests. Yet the
Old Catholic movement, despite the well-earned eminence of some of
its leaders, such as Döllinger, was destined to failure from the start.
It sought a compromise where no compromise was possible—asserting
the right of private judgment against the Church Universal only to a
certain point, and that point one which concerned itself rather with
intellectual subtleties than actual daily affairs. The unbearable oppressions
which lent practical application to the polemics of Luther
no longer existed; and the secular powers of Europe felt too secure
in their ability to defend themselves against ecclesiastical encroachment
to give substantial aid to the opponents of Rome. The Old
Catholic schism may therefore already be regarded almost as a thing
of the past, and one which will exercise no influence over the future.</p>

<p>A more serious blow than that which Döllinger and his friends
sought to aim at the Roman curia has been dealt, in the matter of
marriage, by the adoption, in successive Catholic states, of what is
known as Civil Marriage, by which matrimony is withdrawn from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_605">605</span>
the exclusive control of the church, and the sacrament and benediction
are declared to be accidents not necessary to the legal status of
husband and wife or to the legitimacy and heritable capacity of children.
We have already seen that this was one of the legislative
results of the French Revolution, and the example thus early set by
France has been followed of late by Italy and Austria after its adoption,
in 1853 by Sardinia, as one of the earliest reformatory measures
of Cavour. Yet the church positively refuses to regard such marriages
as entitled to respect. When the project was under discussion
in Italy, the <i>Unità Cattolica</i>, one of the papal organs, in its issue
of July 16th, 1864, did not hesitate to assert that the establishment
of civil matrimony was establishing the liberty of licentiousness, and
that, after having scattered houses of ill-fame throughout Italy, it
would convert the whole peninsula into one brothel. In a similar
spirit, Pius IX., in his allocution of October 30th, 1866, denounced
it as leading to an organized system of scandalous concubinage.
When, in May, 1868, Austria followed the example of Italy, Pius,
within a month, delivered an allocution, in which he not only condemned
the “abominable law,” but declared it to be null and void;
and Cardinal Rauscher, Archbishop of Vienna, issued a manifesto,
in which he not only denied that the civil contract constituted marriage
and directed that children sprung from such unions should be
entered on the parish registers as neither legitimate nor illegitimate,
but gave positive instructions that absolution should be denied, even
<i>in articulo mortis</i>, to all parties who had cohabited in such unions—thus
stigmatizing them as worse than concubinage. In a similar
spirit, when, in 1869, civil marriage was proclaimed under the short-lived
republic of Spain, the clergy, under inspiration from the Vatican,
denounced it as concubinage, and threatened to suspend the
celebration of the Mass. With the restoration of the monarchy the
law was promptly repealed, and an effort to restore it was rejected
by an emphatic vote of the Cortes in February, 1883, though, with
the more liberal tendencies that have since arisen, the matter is again
proposed for discussion. Leo XIII. has been vigorous in his opposition
to the innovation. In his first Encyclical, issued April 21st,
1878, he declared that “citizens, profaning the dignity of Christian
marriage, have adopted legal concubinage in place of religious matrimony;”
and he returned to the attack in a special Encyclical on the
subject, published February 10th 1880. In this he assumes that, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_606">606</span>
“by the will of Christ the church alone can and ought to legislate
and decide concerning sacraments, so it is out of the question to
attempt to transfer any, even the smallest part, of her power to the
government of the state,” and therefore “judicial sentences on conjugal
contracts, as to whether they have been entered upon rightly
or wrongly,” are a direct infringement of the rights of the church,
whether those judgments be adverse or not to the canons.</p>

<p>The earlier passages of this Encyclical are so warm and eloquent
a defence of the holiness of matrimony, as the natural condition of
man decreed by God, that it would probably trouble its author to
explain why so exalted and divine a state should be prohibited to
the ministers of the God who devised it and fitted his creatures
specially for it. Yet the persistent and bitter opposition of the
church to the civil marriage laws may not unreasonably be attributed
to the fact that under them the state has the power to recognize and
permit clerical marriage. For more than half a century such laws
had existed in France, but as the French tribunals leaned towards
upholding ecclesiastical celibacy, they were acquiesced in comparatively
in silence. When Italy, however, followed the example, it
was seen that the temper of the Italian government would lead to
construing them in a sense favorable to priestly liberty, and hence
the opposition, which has been justified and intensified by the result.
Immediately on the passage of the Civil Marriage Act, Dr. Prota,
of Naples, an energetic reformer within the church, in a letter of
October 30th, 1865, advised all his clerical friends to marry and to
persist in the exercise of their functions, “and the more who do so
at once and simultaneously the safer for all, for the bishops will venture
the less to persecute you in the face of public opinion.” Accordingly
cases of priestly marriage commenced to occur, and when they
were contested their validity was confirmed by the tribunals. The
superior courts of Genoa, Trani, and Palermo successively decided
in this sense, and finally, in 1869, occurred the case of Andrea
Treglia, of the diocese of Salerno, which settled the question in
Naples. The municipal officers of Vietri refused to marry him; the
court of Salerno decided against him, but when the matter was carried
up to the court of appeals of Naples judgment was rendered in
his favor, and he was married forthwith—thus legitimating the unions
of some fifty priests who had preceded him, without the question
having been settled by the tribunal of last resort. In the organ of
the reforming Catholics of Naples, the <i>Emancipatore Cattolica</i>, it
is curious to see the successive marriages chronicled with the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_607">607</span>
satisfaction as that evinced by Spalatin in the stormy days of
Luther.<a id="FNanchor_1586_1586" href="#Footnote_1586_1586" class="fnanchor">1586</a></p>

<p>Yet the whole question is one of but slender practical importance.
In no country is the Catholic church subservient to the state. It
controls its own sacraments, and no government is likely to venture
upon interference with it in its own sphere. While, therefore, it
may be deprived of the power to persecute and punish those of its
members who enter upon civil marriage, it yet possesses the ability
to deprive them of their functions, which in most cases is equivalent
to depriving them of bread; and it has an unquestioned right to
expel them from its communion. The priest who marries, therefore,
is virtually separated from his church and deprived of his means of
livelihood—motives which, combined with the moral forces at work
to keep men within the accustomed bounds, are quite sufficient to
prevent defection from growing common, or to render marriage with
a priest attractive to women above the lowest class. Even in the
United States, where there is no legal impediment to priestly marriage,
and the tone of society is such as rather to welcome those who
escape from the pale of Rome, such cases are very rare. A few
years since one occurred in Philadelphia, and in February, 1882,
Father Agudi, of Hartford, committed matrimony, but these are the
only instances which I remember to have noted for many years past.
While, therefore, the civil marriage laws of Europe unquestionably
loosen the ties which in this respect bind the priest to his church,
there are still sufficient material and moral forces at work to prevent
desertions from this cause from assuming any serious proportions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Predictions, as a rule, are idle, and yet it would appear entirely
safe to assume that those who look forward to a change in the policy
of the church as regards the enforcement of celibacy among its
ministers are prompted rather by their wishes than by judgment, or
by knowledge of the influences at work. It matters little what may
be the aspirations of the vast body of men who form the working
ecclesiastical force—the humble priests and curés upon whom it depends
for its support among the populations. The autocratic theocracy,
founded in the dark ages, and strengthened by the council of Trent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_608">608</span>
received its final and irrevocable shape when the church submissively
adopted the Vatican decree, which declared “that the Roman pontiff,
when he speaks <i>ex cathedra</i>, that is, when in discharge of the office
of pastor and doctor of all Christians, by virtue of his supreme
apostolic authority, he defines a doctrine regarding faith or morals,
to be held by the universal church, by the divine assistance promised
him in blessed Peter, is possessed of that infallibility with which the
divine Redeemer willed that his church should be endowed for defining
doctrine regarding faith or morals; and that therefore such
definitions are irreformable of themselves, and not from the consent
of the church. But if any one—which may God avert—presume to
contradict this definition let him be anathema.”<a id="FNanchor_1587_1587" href="#Footnote_1587_1587" class="fnanchor">1587</a> It would be futile
to imagine after this that any pressure could be brought to bear upon
the Roman curia sufficient to induce a change in its immemorial
policy—a change, moreover, which would overwhelm it with the
bitterest humiliation by contradicting all its teachings since the days
of St. Jerome. What was so unbendingly refused to all the princes
and nearly all the clergy of Catholic Christendom in the doubtful
days of the Reformation will not be granted now, when, despite the
destruction of the temporal power in Italy, the spiritual influence of
the church is as great as ever, and it sees the results of its policy in
the rapidly extending area of its domination. When Pius IX. could
boast that during his single pontificate he had founded twenty-nine
metropolitan sees and one hundred and thirty episcopal dioceses,
there would seem to be no valid reason, from the stand-point of the
Vatican, for an act so revolutionary as the abrogation of celibacy,
which would convert its janizaries into householders, with human
interests dissociated from those of the church-militant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The monastic orders have not escaped the innovating spirit of the
nineteenth century. In Spain, the revolutionary cortes of 1820
enacted a law suppressing all the existing monastic foundations, excepting
the Knights of Malta and the Hospitalarios de San Juan,
and further prohibiting the founding of new institutions and the administering
of vows; but when in 1823 the constitutional government
fell under French bayonets, the Orders reëstablished themselves
and took a bloody revenge upon their persecutors. Again in 1836
the government of Isabella II. undertook the same task, excepting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_609">609</span>
the Padres de las Escuelas Pias, the Hospitalarios de San Juan, and
the Clerigos de la Mision, but the attempt was short-lived; as was
also that of 1868 under the Republic. In the Netherlands, a series
of laws adopted between 1818 and 1826 forbade the admission of
novices in the contemplative orders, which, being of no public utility,
had no claim for recognition; and irrevocable vows, moreover, were
declared illegal. In 1820 a similar effort was made in Naples, but
it was unsuccessful. In the New World still more sweeping reforms
have been undertaken. Thus Paraguay, in 1824, suppressed all
monasteries as useless; Brazil, in 1829, prohibited the entrance of
new devotees in the existing foundations, thus condemning them to
gradual extinction; and in 1851 New Grenada not only expelled
the Company of Jesus and forbade the establishment of any Order
professing the doctrine of passive obedience, but threw open the doors
of all religious establishments, and promised legal protection to those
who should abandon them. Ten years later it suppressed them
altogether, and in 1874 its example was followed in Venezuela.<a id="FNanchor_1588_1588" href="#Footnote_1588_1588" class="fnanchor">1588</a>
In 1849, one of the first acts of the Roman Republic was to liberate
all monks and nuns from obedience to their vows; and in 1853
Cavour suppressed all the monastic houses of the Kingdom of
Sardinia, applying their property to the improvement of the clergy,
in spite of the superstitious fears excited by the almost simultaneous
deaths of several members of the royal family. After the formation
of the Kingdom of Italy, the law of June 28th, 1866, completed the
suppression of all the religious houses, pensioned or subsidized their
members, and confiscated their property. This process of secularization
was rapidly carried out, and early in 1867 the journals
reported that nearly all the inmates of the monasteries were dispersed,
some of them returning to their families, some of them accepting
refuge offered by the charitable, but most of them clubbing together
and hiring houses in which to live as of old. Two exceptions,
indeed, were made in the enforcement of the law. Monte Casino,
the venerable mother of western monachism, was spared, and provision
made for its maintenance as a national monument; while
Savonarola’s convent of San Marco was similarly favored, rather
perhaps because of its frescoes than of its historical associations.
Against all this the church of course protested vigorously, pronounc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_610">610</span>ing
the suppression of the orders and the secularization of their possessions
to be null and void; but the readiness with which purchasers
were found to give even more than the appraised value of the property,
shows how futile was resistance to the tendency of the age.</p>

<p>So great a social revolution was of course not effected without
much of individual suffering, which, in some cases at least, was not
diminished by the methods adopted in enforcing the law. The fact
that in 1856, 8000 monks petitioned Pius IX. for secularization,
shows that the ideas of the age had penetrated into some of the
monasteries, but in the greater number of cases the inmates were
naturally averse to the change. Panzini, who can assuredly not be
regarded as a prejudiced witness, speaks with bitter indignation of
the files of soldiery sent to drive from their houses the terrified nuns,
who were thrown upon the world without the means of subsistence
or the training to earn a livelihood, while their vows precluded them
from marrying or from worldly employment. Even the private
fortunes brought by them in many cases to their convents shared the
common fate of confiscation, and they sought in vain to have their
dowers restored to them.<a id="FNanchor_1589_1589" href="#Footnote_1589_1589" class="fnanchor">1589</a> It is impossible not to feel sympathy for
those whose misfortune consists in having been born too late, and
who are made to expiate the sins of a system which they have reverently
received from their forefathers. The student of the past,
moreover, may be pardoned a feeling of regret at the destruction of
the venerable institutions which, for a thousand years, fostered the
religious growth of Christendom; but the civilization which they
rendered possible has outgrown them. In the history of development
it is inevitable that Zeus should dethrone his father Cronos;
and the progress of humanity demands the removal of that which has
outlived its usefulness, and has become only a stumbling-block in the
path of human improvement.</p>

<p>Pius IX. himself had felt the need of some measure of reform in
the religious orders, but was powerless to enforce it. It is asserted
that before his early liberal tendencies had become completely eradicated,
on his return from Gaeta, he entertained the idea of rendering
life in common indispensable in all monastic institutions, of substituting
for the irrevocable vow one which should be renewable at a
fixed interval, and of deferring all ordinations to the priesthood until
the applicant should have entered on his 36th year. These sensible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_611">611</span>
measures, however, were opposed so strenuously by all the officials
that the Pope gave way—the General of the Franciscans even proclaiming
vehemently that they would assuredly result in the destruction
of all the religious orders.<a id="FNanchor_1590_1590" href="#Footnote_1590_1590" class="fnanchor">1590</a> It would seem that Pius eventually,
in this respect as in others, fell completely into the hands of the
ultra-conservatives, for though in 1857 he defined that the simple
vow of the novitiate should not be taken before the age of 16, and
that the irrevocable vow should be deferred until the accomplishment
of a novitiate of three years, yet the following year he decreed that
the simple vow of the novice was irrevocable, except by papal dispensation,
unless, indeed, the general of the order should see fit to
expel the postulant.<a id="FNanchor_1591_1591" href="#Footnote_1591_1591" class="fnanchor">1591</a> It is remarked, moreover, that while he not
infrequently exercised his dispensing power in releasing worthy applicants
from the vows of poverty and obedience, he never absolved
them from that of chastity;<a id="FNanchor_1592_1592" href="#Footnote_1592_1592" class="fnanchor">1592</a> though it is not unreasonably urged that
all enlightened legislation holds engagements, even in matters of
trifling import, to be invalid when made by minors, while the church
permits, and even incites, children in their sixteenth year to enter
into obligations the nature of which they are unable to appreciate,
and then unyieldingly exacts of them the rigid execution of the rash
promise, under pain of eternal damnation.</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding these successive shocks, monasticism has
rarely been more flourishing or more vigorous than of late years.
Warned by the successive secularization of its temporalities in one
country after another, the church has learned to give to the monastic
system the direction in which its evils are least sensibly felt, its benefits
to humanity are greatest, and the influence which it is capable
of exerting is most serviceable to the hierarchy. Though at times
mistaken in the spirit of the age; though often misled by pride, by
ambition, and by avarice, the Roman church has missed its aim and
mistaken its vocation, yet, upon the whole, it has manifested that
adaptation to the wants of successive generations which is the real
secret of its power and the condition of its success. Clearly recognizing
the scant toleration which our hard-working nineteenth cen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_612">612</span>tury
has for holy idleness and unproductive sanctity, it moulds its
institutions to meet the necessities of the age. It no longer glories
in new and fantastic forms of worship or insane feats of asceticism—not
the pillar of Stylites, the poverty of Francis, or the thong of
the Flagellants<a id="FNanchor_1593_1593" href="#Footnote_1593_1593" class="fnanchor">1593</a>—but it seeks to organize systems by which the
beneficence of the many may be efficiently administered by the
trained labor of the few. It endeavors no longer to agglomerate
around idle communities the wealth which could only pander to their
vices, but rather to render useful by associated action the benevolent
self-abnegation which in other communions is apt to be lost or frittered
away for lack of judicious organization and direction. When
thus the vow of celibacy is uttered, not in the hope of a life of ease
and sensual indulgence, not in the pride of Pharisaical holiness, not
in the lust of exaggerated maceration, not in the hope of purchasing
by solitude and mortification the favor of an all-merciful Creator,
but for the single-minded purpose of devoting a life to elevating
fellow-creatures from degradation or to relieving their physical and
mental miseries, no one can deny that institutions which in their
wantonness of prosperity accomplished so much of evil possess
fruitful germs of good to be developed through adversity and tribulation.</p>

<p>The results of this wise policy have shown themselves especially
in France and Belgium. When, in 1625, St. Vincent de Paul
founded the Order of the Sisters of Charity, he accomplished a
work which was destined to prove as useful to the church as the
mendicant and preaching orders which resuscitated it in the thirteenth
century, or the Company of Jesus, which enabled it to set
bounds to the Protestant Reformation. It was a return to the
primal and vital principles of Christianity, which bound anew the
peoples to the hierarchy and bridged over the all but impassable
gulf between them.</p>

<p>This tie, so delicate and yet so firm, proved lasting. Even amid
the horrors of the Revolution, when conventual vows were forbidden,
and the monastic orders were scattered ruthlessly abroad, the gentle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_613">613</span>
virtues and the tireless ministrations of the Sisters of Charity won
for them respect and toleration from the cruel fanatics who respected
and tolerated nothing else. When, even under the Concordat of
1801, the reëstablishment of monastic orders was strictly forbidden,
and those which endeavored timidly to organize themselves under
the names of <i>Pères de la Foi</i>, <i>Victimes de l’Amour de Dieu</i>, <i>Cœur
de Jésus</i>, etc., were broken up in 1804 without ceremony,<a id="FNanchor_1594_1594" href="#Footnote_1594_1594" class="fnanchor">1594</a> exceptions
were made in favor of the charitable associations of females, the missionary
societies of Saint-Esprit and the Lazaristes, and the brotherhood
of the <i>Écoles Chrétiennes</i>. The missionary societies proved
to be a focus of reactionary intrigue, which the First Empire was
powerful enough to crush. They were accordingly suppressed in
1809, but at the same time an imperial decree placed under the
fostering care of Madame Lætitia the women who devoted themselves
to works of charity and mercy. Annual appropriations for
their support were regularly made, and, thus favored, they prospered
amazingly. The religious activity of the people seemed to flow in
this channel with redoubled force from its long retention, and in the
eight years from 1807 to 1815 there were no less than 1261 congregations
authorized—an average of 157 per annum. At the same
time the state refused to recognize the right of any person to abstract
himself irrevocably from society. The law wisely prohibited engagements
for life in any service, and this was held applicable to the
religious congregations, in which, by the decree of 1809, the period
of engagement was limited to five years.<a id="FNanchor_1595_1595" href="#Footnote_1595_1595" class="fnanchor">1595</a></p>

<p>In spite of the favor shown to the charitable associations, the prejudice
against the monastic system was still so strong that the
Restoration, with all its reactionary tendencies, did not dare to run
counter to the convictions of the people. The law of 1809 forbidding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_614">614</span>
male congregations was never repealed, and the most that the Bourbons
ventured openly to do was to authorize a few by special decree,
such as the Lazaristes, the Missions Etrangères, &amp;c. Meanwhile
the female congregations continued to increase; a general law was
enacted in May, 1825, providing for their authorization under definite
provisions, and between 1815 and 1830, 643 new ones were
officially recognized. The efforts made from 1825 to 1827, under
Charles X., to introduce the Jesuits and other male orders gave rise
to lively agitation, and the elections of 1827 settled the question
definitely in the negative.<a id="FNanchor_1596_1596" href="#Footnote_1596_1596" class="fnanchor">1596</a> The Revolution of 1830 put an end for
the time to all hope of reëstablishing the monastic system in France,
and a law in 1834 specially affirmed the application of Art. 291 of
the Penal Code, directed against unauthorized associations, to those
for religious purposes. The constitutional government of Louis
Philippe showed itself persistently hostile to monachism. It is true
that in 1840 Lacordaire succeeded in obtaining sufferance for his
order of Dominicans, but this was exceptional; and even towards
the female orders the policy of the monarchy was repressive. During
the eighteen years of its existence, but fourteen authorizations for
founding new congregations were granted, while the Jesuits, who
had ventured to enter the kingdom without permission, were formally
expelled in 1845 after a severe parliamentary struggle. The Second
Republic was more liberal, and the Second Empire ostentatiously
sought the alliance of the church. The Loi Falloux, in 1850, seemed
to recognize the existence of male orders, and advantage was immediately
taken of a vague phrase to assume their legality. At length,
in 1852, a law was passed regulating, by a general form, the incorporation
of all religious societies, and under this their growth was
amazingly rapid—none the less so, perhaps, because they were not
even required by the authorities to observe the law and go through
the formality of procuring authorizations. In 1827 there were but
20,943 female devotees, while the number of males under conventual
vows was too insignificant for computation,<a id="FNanchor_1597_1597" href="#Footnote_1597_1597" class="fnanchor">1597</a> and under the monarchy
of July the growth was exceedingly small. In 1861 these had increased
to 17,776 males and 90,343 females, and in 1877 to 22,207
males and 127,000 females.</p>

<p>In Belgium the figures are equally startling. In 1856 that little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_615">615</span>
kingdom had 2383 monks and 12,247 nuns—a total of 14,630—an
enormous proportion in so small a population, enabling the clergy,
as has more than once been seen, almost to control the elections.</p>

<p>To comprehend the full significance of these figures, they may be
compared with the undisturbed monasticism of an old Catholic state
such as Austria. That empire, in 1859, had but 10,449 monks and
6463 nuns, or 16,912 in all. For the Catholic population alone of
Austria, this gives one to every 1579 inhabitants, while, about the
same period in France the proportion was one to every 346 souls,
and in Belgium, one to every 308.</p>

<p>The Company of Jesus furnishes an equally instructive illustration
of the flourishing condition and rapid growth of monachism despite
the shackles apparently imposed on it by modern institutions. The
Jesuits, formally reëstablished in 1814 by Pius VII. and gradually
working an entrance into one kingdom after another, have increased
with a rapidity which is exceedingly significant.</p>

<p>and a still later computation gives them 7949 members, divided into
3389 priests, 2323 brother coadjutors, and 2237 novices—the large
proportion of the latter indicating how great is the prospective increase.
In France alone their number had grown from 200 in 1845
to 1085 in 1865, and to 1509 in 1877.</p>

<p>In this enormous spread of monachism, it is interesting to observe
the change which has occurred from mediæval sensual indulgence and
mystic asceticism to modern utilitarianism. Thus in France, by the
census of 1861, there were, out of 17,776 men bound by vows,</p>

<p>The large proportion of almoners and hospital nurses among the
women is easily explicable by what has already been stated as to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_616">616</span>
favor shown by successive governments to the Sisters of Charity,
and the good which is effected by these organizations cannot easily
be overrated. Who is there who can fail to do justice to these
humble Christians, when once he has had the good fortune to witness
their self-devotion and the benefits arising from their tireless ministrations,
made doubly valuable by system and special training? In
our own land, torn by sudden and gigantic civil war, when the sick
and wounded had accumulated almost beyond the possibility of care,
who that then noted the blessed agency of those angels of the hospital,
would willingly pause to coldly criticise the institutions of which
they are the most perfect development? In a Catholic country like
France, the opportunities for good works are of course vastly
greater, for almost every benevolent institution naturally seeks the
aid of the church, and that aid is willingly given, not only from
charitable motives, but also, we may assume, on account of the
enormous influence thence accruing among the masses of the population
who are the beneficiaries, and this is especially felt in the
manufacturing centres and amid the periodical crises attendant upon
modern financial and industrial development. The crèches where
babies are kept while their mothers are at the factory are presided
over by nuns; the distribution of bread and soup at the Bureaux
de Bienfaisance is made by nuns; the neglected and wretched little
children who are sent to the infant schools are washed and tended
by nuns;<a id="FNanchor_1598_1598" href="#Footnote_1598_1598" class="fnanchor">1598</a> and, in fact, whatever tender, or humane, or charitable
influence reaches the prolétaire in his grieving and despairing
wretchedness, almost necessarily comes to him through some channel
connected with a religious order.</p>

<p>A much more complex question, however, is presented by the
numbers and the activity of the orders devoted to education. While
giving due weight to the purely benevolent impulses which lead so
many to undertake the task of training the young, and while freely
acknowledging the vast amount of good arising from the education,
in so many cases gratuitous, of those who might otherwise remain
in the darkness of ignorance, the inquirer cannot shut his eyes to
other considerations. The eagerness with which the church seeks to
acquire for itself the direction of the docile mind of childhood shows
how fully it is alive to the importance of this most fruitful source of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_617">617</span>
influence. Previous to 1849, the educational system of France was,
nominally at least, in the hands of the State, though even then the
church had made large inroads upon its province. The leading instrumentality
in this was the congregation of the <i>Frères des Écoles
Chrétiennes</i>, founded in 1680 by the Abbé de la Salle, for the
gratuitous instruction of the poor, and Frère Philippe, the General
of the Order, testified in 1849 before a parliamentary committee that
the body then consisted of 3300 members with 200,000 children
under their care. The spread of communism among the people, as
manifested in the overthrow of the monarchy, alarmed the conservatives,
and one of the first acts of the Republic under Louis Napoleon
was to encourage by the <i>Loi Falloux</i> the efforts of the church to
extend its operations. How successful was the attempt is shown by
a comparison of the statistics of twenty years.</p>

</table></div>

<p>By 1861, in the next grade of schools, the religious orders had
55,151 male pupils, while those in the government institutions of
similar class numbered only 63,291. In 1865 the whole number of
children between the ages of 7 and 12 in France was 4,018,427;
while, two years previous, out of 2,265,576 boys attending school,
443,732 were in institutions conducted by the religious orders, and
of 2,070,612 girls, no less than 1,166,942, or more than half, were
under the care of sisterhoods.</p>

<p>This enormous and rapidly increasing proportion shows how largely
the coming generation is trained under monkish influences, and
justifies the efforts made by the Ferry ministry, after the overthrow
of the reactionary government of MacMahon, to check the
growth of these schools. The religious orders are bound to a peculiar
obedience to the Holy See; all other bonds, whether of family
or of country, are as nothing in comparison. The monk who conscientiously
regards his vows cannot be a citizen, or be fitted to
train future citizens. The congregation, for instance, of the <i>Frères
de la Saintè-Croix</i> is largely engaged in educating and furnishing
teachers; and among the secret statutes of the order is one forbidding
its members to admit the existence of any opinion, whether in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_618">618</span>
politics, theology, or religion, contrary to the opinion of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_1599_1599" href="#Footnote_1599_1599" class="fnanchor">1599</a>
What are the political opinions of Rome may readily be found in the
Syllabus of 1864, among its anathemas directed against freedom of
thought and of the press, against any liberty which threatens to
abridge the temporal power of the hierarchy or to limit its absolute
authority, and indeed against the simplest toleration in the matter of
religious belief. That these are in fact the principles which govern
education in clerical schools was shown during the debates on the
Ferry laws in 1879, by M. Ferry, who had, after some difficulty,
procured copies of text-books used in them, and who quoted from
them passages praising feudal rights and reviling the Revolution,
justifying the Inquisition and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes,
denouncing civil marriage as concubinage, alluding to religious
toleration as a temporary necessity, and inculcating the doctrine of
the submission of the state to the church. It needs no argument to
show that institutions which teach such principles as these are not
fit to be trusted with the training of those who are to constitute a
self-governing Republic.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only evil arising from the successful efforts made
by the church through its monastic legions to control the education
of France. The enormous demand for recruits to fill the rapidly
growing ranks of its army of teachers exceeded its capacity to provide
suitable material, whether as regards mental or moral training. In
its desire to favor the growth of clerical schools, the Second Empire
waived in favor of the religious orders the rigorous examinations
required of the laity as a condition precedent to employment as
teachers. The supervision of the state being thus withdrawn, discretion
was left with those whose unworldly duties can scarcely be supposed
to render them competent judges, and that discretion has been
necessarily much abused. It is related by Mdlle. Daubié, herself
an instructress of high reputation, that when she was eight years old
she was applied to, by a woman employed in tending cows, to teach
her the catechism, and within a year she was surprised to find her
whilom pupil suddenly reappear as a sister, duly authorized to teach.
It is computed that, among the male religious employed in teaching,
not more than one in ten has the <i>brevet</i>, which would be indispensable
to them if they were laymen; while, of the sisters engaged in instruc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_619">619</span>tion,
out of 8000 superiors of institutions, only about 1000 are
<i>brevetées</i>, and, of their assistants, not more than one per cent. are
so qualified.</p>

<p>If the mental qualifications of these educators were thus disregarded,
their moral characters were equally relieved from proper
scrutiny; and this, combined with the temptations inseparable from
the celibate system, has not infrequently led to the most shocking
results. The enormous influence of the ecclesiastical establishment,
working upon the bureaus of the government, the officials of justice,
and the press, was usually sufficient to prevent much public scandal
under Louis Napoleon and Marshal MacMahon; but a list of the
prosecutions reported in the newspapers from 1861 to April, 1879,
collected by Dr. Wahu,<a id="FNanchor_1600_1600" href="#Footnote_1600_1600" class="fnanchor">1600</a> shows about fifty cases in which the male
teachers had abused the children under their charge, many of these
cases being of appalling turpitude. As eleven of these occurred
during the first three months of 1879, it may reasonably be concluded
that equal freedom on the part of the public prosecutors and
the press during the previous eighteen years would have produced a
vastly larger number of convictions; and not the least deplorable
feature of the matter is that in more than one case the culprit had
been previously transferred several times from one institution to
another, giving grounds for the assumption that the authorities were
cognizant of his wickedness, and preferred to allow him to spread
contagion throughout different communities rather than incur the
scandal of punishing him.</p>

<p>As illustrative of two phases of the subject, I may briefly refer to
two cases from among a number which were brought to light in 1861,
as the result of the efforts of a writer bold enough to brave the anger
of the church, and who found a journal with the hardihood to second
his efforts. One of these occurred at Saintes, in a school under the
care of the <i>Frères des Écoles Chrétiennes</i>. Out of 300 boys, one
hundred had been the victims of the monsters to whom they had been
confided, and who enjoyed with a Satanic zest the corruption which
they spread through so many households. The evil became rumored
abroad, but no one dared to attack the members of so powerful an
order, until an old soldier who held the post of gendarme found the
evil in his family. Unused to prudence, he complained. The local
board of supervision, afraid of compromising the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_620">620</span> “interests of religion,”
endeavored to hush up the affair, but the prefect, fortunately,
was of different temper, and took up the matter energetically. The
guilty brethren disappeared, and their superior professed to know
nothing about them, while the gendarme was soon afterwards dismissed
from his post, and the matter passed over, leaving nothing
behind it but a hundred ruined youths and corrupted families. The
other case is that of Frère Cléonique at Jonsac, whose offences were
too fully proved for denial, and whose counsel on his trial could only
urge in palliation that the responsibility rested, not on his client,
but on the system which employed such creatures and exposed them
to temptations beyond their strength—“Gentlemen,” said he, “look
at my client. What is he, after all? A clown, a <i>goîtreux</i>, almost
a <i>crétin</i>; surely less than a man! He was herding flocks, when
they undertook to persuade him that he had a call. A black gown
was thrown on his shoulders, and, behold him in charge of a school!
Such a nature could only attempt that career through pride and sloth.
There he is, utterly untrained, ignorant of everything in life, and yet
charged with teaching our children how to live!... Do you wonder
that one day the beast awoke in that soul, into which nothing lofty
had been instilled?... There he is before you, but who is really
to blame; who is the criminal? Assuredly not this poor wretch,
involved in the blindest ignorance, whom they drew from his obscurity,
and to whom they taught nothing before confiding to him
the grave responsibility of training youth.” It is satisfactory to
add that this ingenious plea was unsuccessful, and that the brute was
sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor—but he had been seven
years at Jonsac, and his victims counted by the hundred.<a id="FNanchor_1601_1601" href="#Footnote_1601_1601" class="fnanchor">1601</a></p>

<p>It was during these prosecutions, in 1861, that Frère Philippe,
the General of the “<i>Frères des Écoles Chrétiennes</i>,” was stimulated
to issue a secret circular, in which, after alluding to two previous
ones of the same nature sent out in 1854 and 1860, he said that the
time had come to speak plainly about the “horrible disease which
devours the Order,” and which, under the investigations then in progress,
was leading one brother after another to prison, and was sowing
scandal broadcast. But the prosecutions died away, and matters
soon resumed their usual course. It is but two or three years since
that the <i>Bien-Public</i>, in comparing the morality of the lay schools<span class="pagenum" id="Page_621">621</span>
with those in charge of the church, was able to produce these statistics:—</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">In 10,000 lay schools,</td><td class="tdr">5.44</td><td>crimes</td><td>and</td><td class="tdr">22.29</td><td >offences (<i>delits</i>).</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>Nor are these shocking cases confined to France. In 1873 a similar
scandal was suddenly brought to light in the great Barnabite college
at Monza, in Lombardy, where there were more than 300 students,
many of whom were found to have been debauched by their instructors.
The institution was promptly closed by the authorities, but the chief
criminals, Father Stanislas Cereza, the principal, and Father Villa,
one of his assistants, escaped, having prudently disappeared at the
first rumors of the development.</p>

<p>It was, however, political considerations rather than moral ones
which led the French cabinet, shortly after the fall of MacMahon
had destroyed the alliance between church and state, to commence an
attack on the clerical schools. The measure proposed in what were
known as the Ferry laws was certainly not a sweeping one, for the
seventh article, on which the struggle took place, simply provided
that “no man can be allowed to direct an establishment of public or
private teaching, of whatever order this establishment may be, if he
belongs to a <i>non-authorized</i> religious congregation;” and an official
list of the non-authorized congregations showed them to consist merely
of 1502 Jesuits, 327 Dominicans, 222 Marists, 230 Benedictines,
193 Eudists, 65 Basilians, 22 Barnabites, 14 Oratorians, 91 members
of the Congregation of St. Bertin, and 105 of the Congregation
of the <i>Sacré Cœur de Jésus</i>. The measure, in fact, was aimed rather
at the Jesuits than at the others; but clerical influence was as yet
too strong, and after a discussion, which lasted for about nine months,
this section of the law was rejected by the Senate. Jules Ferry
accepted the defeat, but at once announced that the existing statutes
against the Jesuits and other unauthorized orders would be enforced—a
declaration which received the approval of the Chamber of
Deputies. Within a fortnight, on March 31st, 1880, accordingly,
two decrees were issued. The first of these expelled the order of the
Jesuits from France, giving them until June 30th to dissolve, and
allowing a further delay until August 30th for the closing of their
schools and colleges, in order not to inconvenience the students by
dispersing them before the usual period of vacation. The other
decree called upon all non-authorized congregations within three
months to take the necessary steps to obtain the verification and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_622">622</span>
ratification of their statutes and regulations, and the legal recognition
of their establishments, and promising that when this was
done provisions for the male congregations should be made by special
acts, while those for female communities should be by either special
acts or by simple decrees. The enforcement of the existing laws
was threatened against all which should neglect within the given
period to apply for authorization with all the prescribed details.
Now, the laws required that the superiors of all orders should be
residents of France, and that all congregations should submit in
spiritual matters to the jurisdiction of the episcopal ordinaries, while,
in fact, the more important orders have foreign superiors and are
independent of episcopal jurisdiction. It was distasteful in the last
degree to submit to this, and the indisposition to do so was strengthened
by the prospect that each congregation would come before the
Chambers as the subject of a special debate, in which their regulations
would be discussed, with very slender prospect of ultimately
obtaining the desired permission, since a special act would confer on
them the right to hold real-estate—a right which many members,
even of the Catholic Right, were not prepared to grant them.</p>

<p>The result of the first decree was that at the dates appointed the
Jesuit establishments and colleges were closed, with but a faint show
of passive resistance; but, as the members were not personally
exiled, a large portion of them remained, and their colleges were
continued by placing over them as nominal principals influential
laymen under their control.</p>

<p>The second decree struck at 5917 members of unauthorized congregations.
Its execution was postponed in hopes that the bodies
thus threatened would endeavor to comply with the law, but the only
concession they were willing to make was by putting forth a declaration
containing a public act of submission to the constitution and a
resolution to take no part whatever in public or political matters.
At last, in November, 1880, the government found itself obliged to
employ force, and the establishments were closed by the police, aided
where necessary by the military. A general system of passive resistance
had been organized; doors had to be violently broken open,
and the inmates carried out through jeering or sympathizing crowds.
The popular feeling, in fact, had been worked upon as far as possible,
and at some places, as at Lyons, civil conflict seemed for a moment
to be imminent, while at Turquoing (Nord) even blood was shed;
but on the whole the crisis passed away with much less disturbance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_623">623</span>
than had been anticipated. Since then the growing strength of republicanism
throughout France, unimpeded by clerical and reactionary
efforts, shows how much slighter a hold the religious orders had
on the popular mind than had been supposed, and how mistaken had
been Napoleon III. in regarding an alliance with the church as a
necessity for the preservation of his dynasty. In fact, there has
been no banishment of individuals nor expropriation of property.
Though the unauthorized congregations have been dissolved, in
accordance with laws which date back to the <i>Ancien Régime</i>, the
members retain their property, enjoy all the rights of citizenship,
and can perform Mass in the churches near their convents—indeed,
the aristocracy, which naturally affiliates with them, has rather made
a point of offering them ostentatious hospitality.</p>

<p>The effort to separate education from clericalism still continues.
The execution of the decrees was accompanied by the adoption of
laws establishing government colleges for women and providing free
primary education, and, March 24th, 1882, there was passed an act
rendering education compulsory. For nearly nine months there had
been hot debate between the Deputies and the Senators over an
amendment of Jules Simon’s, that instruction should be given in
the public schools on the duties of the pupils “towards God and
towards their country,” but the elections of January, 1882, deprived
the clericals of their power, the Senate receded from the amendment,
and the education provided for by the act is to be purely secular.</p>

<p>It may safely be assumed that France will not abandon the institutions
thus established to attacks by the priesthood such as the
Belgian clergy habitually make upon the public schools of that kingdom.
In a parliamentary debate, February 22, 1881, on this subject,
it was stated, without contradiction, that the curés were in the
habit of refusing communion not only to the children who attend
these schools, but also to their parents and grandparents, uncles, and
aunts—in fact, admission to communion under the circumstances is
the exception and refusal is the rule. Even threats are made to
withhold baptism from future infants, the sacrament is denied to
dying parents, and wives are urged to withdraw from all sexual relations
with their husbands. When spiritual weapons are insufficient,
more carnal means are employed by efforts to ruin the business of
the disobedient by a system of “Boycotting,” which is sometimes
successful; and the enthusiastic curé of Virginal admitted that he
had pronounced it to be a less offence to commit murder than to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_624">624</span>
vote for a Liberal, because Liberalism is heresy.<a id="FNanchor_1602_1602" href="#Footnote_1602_1602" class="fnanchor">1602</a> When such is the
spirit of the church at the present day, French republicanism may
be pardoned for desiring to limit its control over popular education.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It only remains for us to consider what is the present effect of
celibacy on the moral condition of the church, and whether it has
succeeded, after fifteen centuries of fruitless effort, in at last obtaining
a priesthood whose chastity is more than nominal. At the
commencement of the struggle, the great apostle of asceticism, St.
Jerome, calmed the fears of those who dreaded a diminution of population
from the spread of vows of continence, by assuring them that
few would be found to persevere to the end in a task so difficult as
the maintenance of virginity.<a id="FNanchor_1603_1603" href="#Footnote_1603_1603" class="fnanchor">1603</a> Has, then, human nature changed
during the interval, and has the church been justified in its assertion
at the council of Trent that God would not withhold the gift of
chastity from those who rightly seek it, or permit us to be tempted
beyond our strength?<a id="FNanchor_1604_1604" href="#Footnote_1604_1604" class="fnanchor">1604</a> It is certainly not so easy to answer this
question now, as we have seen it in former ages, when men were
more plain-spoken and less decent, when offences against morality
were committed more openly, and when they were denounced both
by the church and its enemies with a distinctness of utterance unfit
for modern ears. Yet it is not impossible to find some evidence
bearing on the question which may enable the impartial inquirer to
arrive at a conclusion.</p>

<p>The church is unquestionably violating the precept “Thou shalt
not tempt the Lord thy God” when, in its reliance that the gift
of chastity will accompany ordination, it confers the subdiaconate
at the age of 22 and the priesthood at 25<a id="FNanchor_1605_1605" href="#Footnote_1605_1605" class="fnanchor">1605</a>—or even earlier
by special dispensation—and then turns loose young men, at the age
when the passions are the strongest, trained in the seminary and
unused to female companionship, to occupy a position in which they
are brought into the closest and most dangerous relations with women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_625">625</span>
who regard them as beings gifted with supernatural powers and
holding in their hands the keys of heaven and hell. Whatever may
have been the ardor with which the vows were taken, the youth thus
exposed to temptations hitherto unknown, finds his virtue rudely
assailed when in the confessional female lips repeat to him the story
of sins and transgressions, and he recognizes in himself instincts and
passions which are only the stronger by reason of their whilom repression.
That a youthful spiritual director, before whom are thrown
down all the barriers with which the prudent reserve of society surrounds
the social intercourse of the sexes, should too often find that
he has over-estimated his self-control, is more than probable.</p>

<p>This, of course, is merely <i>a priori</i> reasoning, and of itself proves
nothing, except the extreme imprudence of a system which applies
fire to straw and assumes that combustion will not follow. Doubtless
there are cases in which the assumption is justified by the result—whole
countries, indeed, where scandals are few. In Ireland, for
instance, we rarely hear of immoral priests, though such cases would
be relentlessly exposed by the interests adverse to Catholicism, and
the proverbial chastity of the Irish women may be both a cause and
a consequence of this. In the United States, also, troubles of the
kind only come occasionally to public view; but here, again, the
church is surrounded by antagonistic churches, the laborers are
few and hardly worked, and the position is not one to attract those
who might seek a life of sloth and indulgence. At the same time,
it must be borne in mind that the extreme care with which the
church avoids scandal renders it impossible for one not within the
pale to ascertain what may really be the relations between ecclesiastics
and the female servants whom, as we shall see, they are permitted
to keep in their houses.</p>

<p>In lands where Catholicism is dominant I fear that there can be
little doubt as to this, although Ernest Renan, a witness of unquestionable
impartiality, whose clerical training gave him every opportunity
of observation, declares emphatically that he has known no
priests but good priests, and that he has never seen even the shadow
of a scandal.<a id="FNanchor_1606_1606" href="#Footnote_1606_1606" class="fnanchor">1606</a> In spite of the Nicæan canon, on which the rule of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_626">626</span>
celibacy has virtually rested, the church, after a struggle of more
than a thousand years, was forced to admit the “subintroducta
mulier” as an inmate of the priest’s domicile. The order of Nature
on this point refused so obstinately to be set aside, that the Council
of Trent finally recognized women as a necessary evil, and only
sought to regulate the necessity by forbidding those in holy orders
from keeping in their houses or maintaining any relations with concubines
or women liable to suspicion.<a id="FNanchor_1607_1607" href="#Footnote_1607_1607" class="fnanchor">1607</a> It is true that the severe
virtue of St. Charles Borromeo refused to grant to a septuagenary
priest a license for more than a year for the residence of a sister
equally aged, and forced him to apply annually for its renewal; it is
also true that the council of Rome, in 1725, allowed the residence
of women only within the first and second degrees of kindred;<a id="FNanchor_1608_1608" href="#Footnote_1608_1608" class="fnanchor">1608</a> but
in modern times the Tridentine canon has been interpreted as allowing
the residence of female servants or house-keepers, in view of the
hardship of doing without domestics and the expense of employing
men. In order to meet the Tridentine caution to avoid suspicion,
efforts have sometimes been made to define a minimum “canonical”
age for these women, varying from thirty to fifty years, but usually
placed at forty—a palliative which, as might be expected, accomplishes
little, even when, as is not always the case, the rule is
observed more scrupulously than by the device of dividing the
canonical age and keeping two girls of twenty.<a id="FNanchor_1609_1609" href="#Footnote_1609_1609" class="fnanchor">1609</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_627">627</span></p>

<p>Few priests, it may be assumed, have the self-denial to live without
this female companionship, which is permitted by the church as
a matter of course. Indeed, the census-paper officially filled in at
the Vatican and returned in January, 1882, stated the population
of the palace to be 500, of which one-third were women. While, of
course, it does not follow that the relations between these women
and the grave dignitaries of the papal court may not be perfectly
virtuous, still, considering the age at which ordination is permitted,
it would be expecting too much of human nature to believe that, in
at least a large number of cases among parish priests, the companionship
is not as fertile of sin as we have seen it to be in every
previous age since the ecclesiastic has been deprived of the natural
institution of marriage. The “niece” or other female inmate of
the parsonage throughout Catholic Europe still excites the smile
of the heretic traveller, and is looked upon as a matter of course
by the parishioner, while the prelates, content if open scandal be
avoided, affect to regard the arrangement as harmless, knowing that
it serves as a preventive of more flagrant and more public trouble,
though the fact that this companionship is made the subject of discussion
and regulation at virtually every council or synod or episcopal
convention held by the church shows that privately it is recognized
as a necessary evil at best. Yet the old sophistry is not
forgotten, which proves that such sin is less than the infraction of
ecclesiastical laws. In a tract in favor of celibacy, published at
Warsaw in 1801, with the extravagant laudation of the authorities,
argument is gravely made that as priestly marriage is incestuous,
such adultery is vastly worse than simple licentiousness, the latter
being only a lapse of the flesh, while marriage would be schism and
arrogant disobedience, involving sin of a far deeper dye.<a id="FNanchor_1610_1610" href="#Footnote_1610_1610" class="fnanchor">1610</a></p>

<p>It would, of course, be vain to expect, at the present day, from
the rulers of the church, the outspoken candor of the Middle Ages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_628">628</span>
when evils were denounced openly and in the coarsest terms. In
those days councils could speak, because none but those connected
with the church were likely to be cognizant of their proceedings;
while, in the 16th and 17th centuries, the immorality of ecclesiastics
was so notorious that no harm could arise from admitting it in the
efforts made for its correction. In modern times, however, when an
external veil of decency is to be maintained before the eyes of antagonistic
critics, when scandal is, of all things, to be avoided, and
when the proceedings of ecclesiastical bodies are carefully revised at
Rome, before they are allowed to become public, with the consciousness
that they may be spread by the press before a world of hostile
mockers, ready to jeer at the woes of the church, only the most
guarded allusions can be made to such subjects, and these only when
the case is urgent. When, therefore, we see that almost every council
held in modern times has deemed it necessary to insist on the supreme
importance of preserving chastity—lying, swearing, stealing, and
other sins not being even alluded to; when the caution against undue
familiarity with women, even devotees, is constantly urged; and
when the relations between the priest and his servant are frequently
indicated by directions that he must not admit her to companionship
at the table, or on walks and journeys, and especially not in visiting
fairs and merrymakings, it would be difficult not to recognize under
this guarded phraseology an admission of the actual relationship
existing between the good pastors and their female inmates, and a
friendly warning, <i>si non caste saltem caute</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1611_1611" href="#Footnote_1611_1611" class="fnanchor">1611</a></p>

<p>It is not often that we can obtain an inside view of these matters,
especially from a source that is at once well informed and not hostile,
but such a view, confirming the worst suspicions, is afforded by an
indignant remonstrance addressed, in 1832, to Monseigneur Sterckx,
Archbishop of Mechlin, by the Abbé Helsen, who for twenty-five
years had been a popular preacher in Brussels.<a id="FNanchor_1612_1612" href="#Footnote_1612_1612" class="fnanchor">1612</a> The abbé calls
upon his prelate to enforce the Tridentine canon by banishing the
women who are universally inmates of the houses of priests, and
thus put a stop to the sin and the scandal which destroy the influence
of the church and spread immorality among the faithful. Even the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_629">629</span>
bishops and dignitaries of the church are not spared, and the archbishop
himself is summoned to dismiss the “Petronilla” who had
accompanied him from the curacy of Bouchout to the cathedral of
Antwerp, and from Antwerp to the metropolitan seat of Mechlin.<a id="FNanchor_1613_1613" href="#Footnote_1613_1613" class="fnanchor">1613</a>
Throughout this plain-spoken epistle the author assumes as a matter
of course not only that the relations between the clergy and their
servants are guilty, but that they are so recognized by every one—so
notorious, indeed, as to need no proof—and, as a natural consequence,
he regards the priesthood as a source of infection destructive
to public morals. The cure is to be found in putting a stop to these
irregular unions—“If women were forever banished from the houses
of ecclesiastics vowed to celibacy, I think we should not see so great
a number of prostitutes who ply their trade at night in our great
cities, nor so many illegitimate children who curse their destiny as
they multiply more and more around us. We ridicule the Seraglio
of the Grand Turk and the polygamy of the Moslem, but they too,
on their side, ridicule the infinite number of strumpets with whom
Christian Europe is deluged, and the custom of keeping as many
concubines as can be afforded. Whence comes to us this shameful
trade, so hurtful to society, which is found under our religion more
than under any other? We dare not doubt that it is the result of
our own misconduct; we dare not accuse only the heretics and the
philosophers of modern times; no, no! the most poisonous spring is
in us, among us, with us, and it will not dry up without us. Let
us blush to our eye-balls; let us hide ourselves from public sight!
Oh for the times and the virtues of the primitive church! Why
come ye not again?”<a id="FNanchor_1614_1614" href="#Footnote_1614_1614" class="fnanchor">1614</a> That this sort of scarcely veiled concubinage
is, in fact, a fruitful source of prostitution can scarcely be doubted
if, as Helsen asserts, the ordinary custom is, when one of these
priest’s servants becomes pregnant and cannot be saved by a prudent
absence, to dismiss her and take another, perhaps younger and more
attractive; and that this may occur repeatedly without the ecclesiastic
being subjected to any special annoyance or supervision—unless,
indeed, he is so ill-advised as to take pity on the unfortunate girl and
refuse to send her away. In that case he becomes a public concubinarian,
liable to the canonical penalties, with which he is sometimes
disciplined. As Helsen indignantly exclaims,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_630">630</span> “Would the Mahometans
tolerate such infamy in their fakirs and dervishes? The Japanese,
the Chinese, the Hindus in their bonzes? The pagans in their
Vestals? Our ancestors in their Druids? Even the Jews and Protestants
have blushed for it, since they advise their Rabbis and ministers
to marry rather than thus to contaminate themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_1615_1615" href="#Footnote_1615_1615" class="fnanchor">1615</a> Helsen
does not fail to allude to the public familiarity of these servants with
their employers—the familiarity condemned in almost the same words
by many of the councils cited above—and it would seem the extreme
of Pyrrhonism to doubt that almost universal concubinage is tolerated,
even where on the surface there are no public scandals to attract
the attention of the malicious.</p>

<p>Testimony of the same nature exists as to Italy, where the upheaval
of the last quarter of a century has created discussion and
brought forth statements of facts and opinions which reveal to some
extent the internal condition of the church. That immorality should
be prevalent would seem to be inevitable, if only from the overgrown
number of the clergy, which has been fostered by the ambition of
the church. In Rome itself, by the census of July 1st, 1867, there
were no less than 7404 ecclesiastics of both sexes, in a population of
215,573, or one to every 29 inhabitants of all ages. In the Pontifical
States, prior to their absorption by the Kingdom of Italy, the
proportion was one to every 55 of the population. In Northern
Italy, embracing the Pontificate, the Duchies, Lombardo-Venetia and
Piedmont, there was one to every 140; while in the whole of Italy,
exclusive of the Pontificate, in 24,231,860 souls there were 174,001
ecclesiastics, showing a proportion of one to 239. These numbers
are so wholly beyond the spiritual needs of the people that it is
evident that an ecclesiastical career must be sought by thousands
who have no vocation for a life of abstinence and self-denial; while
even among those who are induced in the fervor of youth to bind
themselves by the irrevocable vow of chastity, there must be other
thousands who find too late that they have over-estimated their
strength. That passions thus denied their appropriate relief in the
institution of marriage should degenerate often into brutal license, is
too natural to excite special wonder.<a id="FNanchor_1616_1616" href="#Footnote_1616_1616" class="fnanchor">1616</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_631">631</span></p>

<p>It would be difficult to restrain the appetites of so vast a body as
this even with the most determined vigilance on the part of prelates
and in the presence of the sternest popular feeling, but both of these
elements of repression may safely be assumed to be lacking. The
scandal of the Countess Lambertini, whose suit for a share of the
estate of her father, Cardinal Antonelli, has for ten years been before
the Roman courts, would seem to show that even the virtues of
Pius IX. were powerless to eradicate the license which has been traditional
in the papal court; and when a theological manual, which is
still largely used as a text-book in Catholic seminaries, coolly states
that in Italy lust is not regarded as disgraceful,<a id="FNanchor_1617_1617" href="#Footnote_1617_1617" class="fnanchor">1617</a> though we may hope
that the standard of morality has improved since it was written, yet
we cannot expect to find in the people of which such a statement
could be made, the virtue that would hold to strict account a priesthood
whose example has been one of the efficient means of its degradation.
That there is no restraining influence would in fact appear
from the consensus of opinion of all who have had an opportunity
of forming a judgment.</p>

<p>An address purporting to emanate from sixteen bishops to Cardinal
Catarini, begging for an enlargement of the questions to be discussed
in the Vatican Council, assumes the rule of celibacy to be the cause,
not only of heresy and schism, but of scandal to the people and of
disgrace to the church. It speaks of the disgusting trials which are
perpetually coming before the tribunals, making the priestly garb a
source of shame to its wearers, and leading the people to regard
them, not as the flower of the soldiers of Christ, but as a colony
sprung from Sodom.<a id="FNanchor_1618_1618" href="#Footnote_1618_1618" class="fnanchor">1618</a> The Archbishop of Tarento, Giuseppe Capecelatro,
has had no scruple in urging the abrogation of the canon in
order to reduce the immense number of bastards whose existence
disgraces the church.<a id="FNanchor_1619_1619" href="#Footnote_1619_1619" class="fnanchor">1619</a> In a similar mood, D. Marco Petronio, a
priest of Pirano, in Istria, declares that the boasted chastity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_632">632</span>
priesthood has filled the church with demons in place of angels, who
lead their flocks to ruin by their acts and example,<a id="FNanchor_1620_1620" href="#Footnote_1620_1620" class="fnanchor">1620</a> and Panzini
describes the church as a brothel filled with men ruined by the
attempt to deprive them of marriage. When the latter, indeed, was
on his trial before the Inquisition, he asserted that in consequence of
the canon, there were daily committed in Rome itself more than
twenty thousand mortal sins, and the advocate of the Holy Office,
D. Giuseppe Cipriani, contented himself with quietly responding,
“Perhaps not so many.”<a id="FNanchor_1621_1621" href="#Footnote_1621_1621" class="fnanchor">1621</a> We may therefore feel confident that
there is no exaggeration in the remarks of the Rev. William Chauncy
Langdon, who had ample opportunities of observation during his long
residence in Italy as agent of the American Episcopal Church—“I
learned to regard a priest, who had lived all his mature life, openly
and faithfully with a woman to whom he had not of course been
married; by whom he had children now grown up, and for all of
whom he was faithfully providing—with a relative respect as one who
had greatly risen above the morality of his church, and of the
society around him, and whose life really might be considered, on
the dark moral background behind him, a source of relative light.”<a id="FNanchor_1622_1622" href="#Footnote_1622_1622" class="fnanchor">1622</a></p>

<p>We have here an example of the tolerated concubinage which Helsen
describes as universal under the interpretation put upon the Tridentine
canons. It would seem that it ought to be in some degree a
safeguard against worse offences and more public scandals, as a kind
of substitute for marriage; but unlawful indulgence weakens the
power of resistance to temptation and hardens the conscience to sin.
In spite, therefore, of this practical relaxation of the canons, we see
the old troubles of the relations between spiritual directors and their
fair penitents continue to vex the pious. As we have seen with the
less delicate matter of the female companions of the clergy, the
councils of modern times are not likely to be outspoken with regard
to such a subject, but the frequency with which they reiterate commands
that the confessions of women shall not be heard, save in case
of infirmity, except in church; that when heard elsewhere it shall
always be with open doors, and that in church the confessional shall
be in a spot publicly visible, with a grating between the confessor
and his penitent; that before and after sunset the lamps shall always
be lighted, with other similar precautions, shows that the risk is fully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_633">633</span>
recognized and requires constant watchfulness.<a id="FNanchor_1623_1623" href="#Footnote_1623_1623" class="fnanchor">1623</a> Helsen, in fact,
alludes to the scandals of the confessional as a cause of its avoidance
by the faithful and as contributing powerfully to the growth of
religious indifference;<a id="FNanchor_1624_1624" href="#Footnote_1624_1624" class="fnanchor">1624</a> and that these scandals exist is not a mere
matter of conjecture or inference. If it were so, there would be no
need for reiterating the prohibitions against the absolution by confessors
of their fair partners in guilt, which is still occasionally found
to be necessary by modern councils;<a id="FNanchor_1625_1625" href="#Footnote_1625_1625" class="fnanchor">1625</a> nor would Pius IX. in 1866
have felt himself obliged to declare that the power granted to bishops
to absolve in cases reserved to the Pope shall not in future extend to
offences reserved for papal absolution by Benedict XIV.’s Bull
“Sacramentum Pœnitentiæ.” In fact, the crime of “solicitation”
must have become notoriously frequent before the Congregation of
the Inquisition of Rome could have felt impelled, in 1867, to put
forth an Instruction addressed to all archbishops, bishops, and ordinaries,
complaining that the constitutions on the subject did not
receive proper attention, and that in some places abuses had crept
in, both as to requiring penitents to denounce guilty confessors, and
as to the punishing of confessors guilty of solicitation. It therefore
urged the officials everywhere to greater vigor in investigating such
offences and gave a summary of the practice of the Inquisition in
regard to these matters, supervision over which, it will be remembered,
was confided to the Holy Office by the Bulls of Pius IV. and
Gregory XVI. From this it appears that when such a denunciation
is received, it is the custom of the Inquisition to order the accused
to be watched, and not to prosecute him unless he is the subject of
three separate accusations. When this number has been reached, a
special court is convened whose business it is to examine whether
there may not be some special enmity on the part of the accusers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_634">634</span>
Failing this, the accused is then examined under oath, care being
taken not to reveal the names of the accusers nor to violate the seal
of the confessional. If the transgressor confesses or is convicted, he
is deprived forever of the faculty of hearing confessions and must
abjure the heresy implied in his crime; but the severer punishments
decreed by Gregory XV. of degradation from holy orders and delivery
to the secular arm are not to be inflicted. Those who voluntarily
confess without being denounced, even though they may
subsequently be denounced, are allowed to escape with a suitable
penance and are ordered merely not to hear subsequently the confessions
of those whom they have solicited; confession after denunciation,
but before trial, also diminishes the penalty. The utmost
secrecy is enjoined on all concerned, who are to be sworn to silence,
and so great a stress is laid on this that even priests are required to
take the oath on the Gospels. The accuser is not to be asked whether
she consented to the solicitation, and if she voluntarily makes such
a statement it is not to be entered in the proceedings of the case.
After the trial is finished, moreover, the whole is to be consigned to
oblivion.<a id="FNanchor_1626_1626" href="#Footnote_1626_1626" class="fnanchor">1626</a> In view of this nervous anxiety for secrecy, and the
tenderness manifested throughout to the offender, it is surely not
uncharitable to conclude that scandal is more feared than sin in these
matters.</p>

<p>Possibly the abuses of the confessional may be less frequent now
than they were in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, yet it is
evident that they are still quite prevalent enough to require a much
more efficient system of repression than they are at all likely to
receive. It is true that the questions put to the penitent by the confessor
are divested of the extremity of brutal coarseness prescribed
by Bishop Burckhardt, but they are still sufficiently suggestive to
be revolting to the pure-minded, and dangerous in no small degree
to those who are likely to lapse.<a id="FNanchor_1627_1627" href="#Footnote_1627_1627" class="fnanchor">1627</a></p>

<p>What in reality is the extent of these abuses can only be a subject
of conjecture. Their very nature causes them to be scrupulously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_635">635</span>
concealed not only by the principals, but by those who may incidentally
find themselves wronged, and the church itself exerts all
its influence to shield the guilty and suppress the scandal. How
powerfully and how unscrupulously its influence is exerted to this
end may be judged from a few examples. In 1817, at Availles, in
France, the sacristan complained to the mayor that his daughter was
received every night by the curé, to the scandal of the people. The
mayor thus invited entered the priest’s house suddenly one night
and found the girl in dishabille, hidden in a corner. He drew up
an official statement of the facts and forwarded it to the authorities,
and the response to this was his summary dismissal from office on
the ground of having violated the domicil of the curé and increased
the scandal.<a id="FNanchor_1628_1628" href="#Footnote_1628_1628" class="fnanchor">1628</a> More recent than this is the notorious case of the
Abbé Mingrat, who while curé of Saint-Opre, near Grenoble, got
into trouble by seducing one of his penitents, but was saved from
prosecution and transferred to Saint-Quentin. Here he established
relations with a devout young married woman, which ended in his
cutting her in pieces with his pocket-knife and throwing the fragments
into the river Isère. Even yet no action would have been
taken had not the mayor of the place insisted, but Mingrat was
enabled to escape to Savoy, where he was provided for as a persecuted
saint.<a id="FNanchor_1629_1629" href="#Footnote_1629_1629" class="fnanchor">1629</a> Similarly, in 1877, the Abbé Debra, condemned at
Liège in default, for no less than thirty-two offences, was, after
proper seclusion in a convent, given a parish in Luxembourg by the
Bishop of Namur.<a id="FNanchor_1630_1630" href="#Footnote_1630_1630" class="fnanchor">1630</a> In the case of the Abbé Mallet, which occurred
in 1861, the church was unable to save the culprit from punishment,
but did what it could to conceal his crimes from the faithful. As a
canon of Cambray, he seduced three young Jewish girls and procured
their confinement in convents under pretext of laboring for their
conversion. One of his victims lost her reason in consequence of
her sufferings, and the court of Douay condemned him to six years
at hard labor—a sentence which was announced by an orthodox
journal thus—“M. le chanoine Mallet de Cambrai, accusé de détournement
de <i>mineurs</i> pour cause de prosélytisme religieux a été
condamné à six ans de reclusion”—where the skilful use of the
masculine “mineurs” and the characterization of his offence as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_636">636</span>
religious proselytism elevate the worst of criminals into a martyr
for the faith.<a id="FNanchor_1631_1631" href="#Footnote_1631_1631" class="fnanchor">1631</a> It is quite within the bounds of probability that, as
such a martyr, he may, since the expiration of his sentence, have
been enjoying, in some cure of souls, the opportunity of repeating
his missionary experiments.</p>

<p>It is evident from these various causes that the criminal records
can give only the barest suggestion as to the extent of crimes thus
committed in secret by a class shielded by influences so powerful.
The records of the <i>ministère de la justice</i>, moreover, are not in
France open to the public, and the only mode of obtaining even an
approximate idea of the number of prosecutions in these cases is to
gather them from the journals in which they chance to appear as
items of news. An attempt to effect this has been made by Dr.
Wahu, and though, from the nature of the case, necessarily imperfect,
it affords some interesting and suggestive statistics. His list extends
from the beginning of 1861 to April, 1879, and is thus tabulated:—</p>

<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>In all 110 cases, of which nearly one-half were brethren connected
with educational institutions, referred to above.</p>

<p>The earlier years of this list must be necessarily imperfect, and,
indeed, M. Charles Sauvestre has given details of nine cases occurring
in schools in 1861,<a id="FNanchor_1632_1632" href="#Footnote_1632_1632" class="fnanchor">1632</a> all which have escaped Dr. Wahu, but,
even making allowance for the impossibility of hunting up all the
fugitive records of the past, the increase during recent years is not
to be regarded as indicating an increase of immorality. It rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_637">637</span>
proves how powerful were the forces protecting the church and repressing
publicity under the Second Empire. The absence of cases
in 1870-1 is probably attributable to the preoccupations of the
Franco-Prussian War and its consequent troubles. While the presidency
of M. Thiers, in 1872, yielded 10 cases, the reactionary government
of Marshal MacMahon showed but 12 cases in four years.
After the fall of MacMahon the number rapidly increases, the first
four months of 1879 affording no less than 19 cases. Whether,
since then, this rate of progression has been maintained I have no
means of knowing, but it is to be hoped that the breaking up of the
unauthorized orders, and the increased vigilance of the authorities,
aided by an aroused public sentiment, have led to a decrease in the
dismal record. One deplorable feature of many of these cases is the
large number of victims frequently represented in a single prosecution,
and that the perpetrator had often been afforded the opportunity
of continuing his crimes in successive situations. Thus, in the affair
of the Abbé Debra, at Liège, in 1877, there were 32 offences charged
against him; and, of those occurring in the single year 1878, frère
Marien was condemned for no less than 299, frère Mélisse, at Saint-Brice,
for 50, frère Climène at Candé, Mazé, and Martigné-Ferchaud,
for 25, and frère Adulphe at Guipry, Saint-Meloir-des-Ondes,
and Pleurtuit, for 67.</p>

<p>It would be a libel on human nature to assert that this catalogue
of sin does not represent more than an average of wickedness, and
the responsibility for the existence of so shocking a condition of
morality must, at least in part, be attributed to the rule of celibacy,
for there is nothing in the status of the church in France to attract
to it those who seek merely a career of sloth and self-indulgence. The
income of the parish priest in France only averages about 1100 francs
per annum, and his position, in a vast majority of cases, is wholly
insecure, being dependent altogether upon the pleasure of his bishop,
who can dismiss him at any moment and thus deprive him of all
means of livelihood. In 1866, out of a total of 33,707 priests in
service, only 3715 held preferment of which they could not be thus
deprived at the whim of their superiors.<a id="FNanchor_1633_1633" href="#Footnote_1633_1633" class="fnanchor">1633</a> A profession so poorly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_638">638</span>
rewarded, subjected to discipline nominally so severe, and held under
such a tenure, can scarce be expected to draw to its ranks men of
character and position; and in fact, the Bishop of Poitiers, in 1877,
made in a pastoral letter the humiliating avowal that the better and
more intelligent classes as a rule avoided the church, which was compelled
to find its recruits among the children of peasants and laborers.
This is confirmed by a work entitled “Le grand péril de l’église de
France,” issued in 1879 by the Abbé Bougaud, Vicar-General of
Bishop Dupanloup of Orléans, by which it appears that the districts
which furnish the most recruits are those which are most ignorant,
and that, as education increases, the willingness to enter the church
diminishes. Moreover, not only is this the case, but even the
numbers of the secular clergy, necessary for the ministrations of
religion, are deficient. In his own diocese of Orléans there were
180 priests lacking, and in that of Troyes there were 100 parishes
without curés; and though the want of qualified ministers was daily
increasing, the pupils in the seminaries were diminishing, and it
seemed impossible to fill the void.<a id="FNanchor_1634_1634" href="#Footnote_1634_1634" class="fnanchor">1634</a> While some allowance must of
course be made for the character of the material thus pressed into
service, this fact only increases the responsibility of those who persist
in subjecting youths fitted neither by nature nor training to the
tremendous strain of enforced celibacy in a career which surrounds
them with the most dangerous temptations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Irrespective of questions of morality, the rule of celibacy in modern
society is harmful to the state in proportion as it contributes to
the aggrandizement of those who enforce it. A sacerdotal caste,
divested of the natural ties of family and of the world, with interests
in many respects antagonistic to the communities in which its members
reside, with aims which, from the nature of the case, must be
for the temporal advancement of its class, is apt to prove a dangerous
element in the body politic, and the true interests of religion, as well
as of humanity, are almost as likely to receive injury as benefit at
its hands, especially when it is armed with the measureless power of
confession and absolution, and is held in strict subjection to a hierarchy.
Such a caste would seem to be the inevitable consequence
of compulsory celibacy in an ecclesiastical organization such as that
of the Catholic church, and the hierarchy based upon it can scarce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_639">639</span>
fail to become the enemy of human advancement, so long as the
priest continues to share the imperfections of our common nature.
How little the aims of that hierarchy have changed with the lapse
of ages may be seen in the pretensions which it still advances, as of
old, to subject the temporal sovereignty of princes and peoples to
the absolute domination of the spiritual power. The temper of Innocent
III. and Boniface VIII. is still the leading influence in its
policy, and the opportunity alone is wanting for it to revive in the
nineteenth century the all-pervading tyranny which it exercised in
the thirteenth. Even the separation of church and state is condemned
as a heresy, and as the state is denied the privilege of defining
the limits of its own authority, and as the right of the church to use
force is asserted, it would be difficult to set bounds to the empire
which is its rightful heritage, and of which it is deprived by the
irreligious tendencies of the age.<a id="FNanchor_1635_1635" href="#Footnote_1635_1635" class="fnanchor">1635</a></p>

<p>Yet, in spite of this antagonism to the spirit of modern society
and civilization, it would be futile to anticipate the downfall of the
church, or even any marked modification in its general organization
or teaching. It arose out of a necessity in human development.
With all its aberrations, it has been, perhaps, the most efficacious
of agencies for the improvement and civilization of man, and it will
not disappear or undergo any essential change until the necessity for
its existence shall have passed away in the elevation of mankind.
The human race is not yet prepared for independence in religious
and moral thought, and the masses in many lands will long require
to be controlled with the awful authority claimed for an infallible
church, and will find inexpressible comfort in that implicit faith
which throws upon another the burden of sin and the responsibility
of salvation. The church thus is doing its work, and has its work
to do. We may, indeed, look forward hopefully to the time when
the diffusion of education and the growth of intelligence will enable
man to throw off the trammels which still are requisite to his well-being
and well-doing, and will seek and obey his Creator without an
intermediary, but that time is yet far off, and until it comes Latin
Christianity has a mission from which it cannot be spared.</p>

<h2 id="NOTE">NOTE.</h2>


<p>A Catholic reviewer of my first edition has assured me that I am in error
in assuming clerical celibacy to be a point of faith in his church. To use his
own words—“The writer is mistaken when he calls the celibacy of the clergy
a point of faith. It never was more than a point of discipline, as is keeping
the fasts and other commandments of the church, which may be modified
by the same authority which prescribed them.” That it may, even as a
point of faith, be abrogated by the same authority which defined it, I do not
doubt, for everything is possible to a General Council guided by an infallible
Pope; that it may now be occasionally represented and even treated as a
point of discipline, I think quite possible and shall not undertake to dispute,
seeing that the Greek discipline is tolerated in that portion of the Greek
church which admits the supremacy of Rome,<a id="FNanchor_1636_1636" href="#Footnote_1636_1636" class="fnanchor">1636</a> but that the council of Trent
intended to make it a point of faith and did so make it is susceptible of the
plainest demonstration. Any one who will read the Tridentine canons (ante,
pp. 536-7) will see that their form is purely doctrinal and not disciplinary.
If this be questioned, I may refer to Chr. Lupus, whose orthodoxy and
accuracy in such matters no good Catholic can doubt, and who informs us,
what indeed is self-evident, that the council of Trent classified its anathemas
of faith as canons, and its regulations of discipline as decrees of reformation—“Sacrosancta
Tridentina synodo fidei anathematismos, canones; morum
autem regulas appellet decreta reformationis” (App. ad Synod. Chalced.
Art. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>—Opp. II. 248), and the anathemas on the subject will be found
classed under the title “Doctrina de Sacramento Matrimonii,” followed by
disciplinary regulations under the rubric “Decretum de Reformatione Matrimonii.”
The form of the canons in fact tells its own story. The dread
anathema, the final and highest condemnation of the church (“Anathema
est æternæ mortis damnatio et non nisi pro mortali debet imponi crimine et
illi qui aliter non potuerit corrigi”—Grat. Decret. P. II. Caus. <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span> Q. iii.
c. 41) is directed, not against him who actually marries, but against those
who assert that all may marry who have not the gift of chastity; and the
same condemnation is pronounced on those who hold that marriage is prefer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_641">641</span>able
to celibacy. It is therefore treated purely as a matter of belief, the
mere discussion of which is practical heresy. This was the form adopted by
the council throughout in defining points of faith, as, for instance, in treating
of Original Sin, which no one will pretend to be a matter of discipline—“Si
quis per Jesu Christi Domini nostri gratiam quæ in baptismate confertur,
reatum originalis peccati remitti negat ... anathema sit” (Sess. <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span> de
Peccat. Orig. c. 5). Any one believing in the validity of priestly marriage
is therefore not merely a contemner of a point of discipline but a heretic,
and it is simply a libel on the good fathers of Trent to assert that they would
anathematize as worthy of perpetual perdition a simple theoretical opinion
on a matter of discipline.</p>

<p>Their intentions, moreover, as to this, are rendered indisputable by the
answer of Pius V. in 1561, just before the final meeting of the Council, to
the demand of Charles IX. for the concession of the cup to the laity. The
pontiff states that he had considered that point and the marriage of the
clergy to be matters of law, and therefore capable of alteration by due authority,
but that, on expressing this opinion in the last conclave, he had been
stigmatized as a Lutheran (Le Plat, Monument. Concil. Trident. IV. 734).
This is confirmed by the remarks of Fra Paolo on the canon which pronounces
the anathema on those who deny that a non-consummated marriage is dissolved
by the vow of either spouse (Sess. XXIV. de Sacram. Matrim. c. vi.),
where he alludes to the surprise caused by making it a point of faith—“Nel
sesto anathematimismo del Matrimonio restarono molti ammirati che fosse
posto per articolo di fede” (Ist. del Concil. Trident. Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>—Ed. Helmstadt.
II. 382).</p>

<p>The same view continued long to be upheld as orthodox. It would be
difficult to find a work published under auspices more authoritative than
Andreas Forster’s “De Cœlibatu Clericorum Dissertatio,” a thesis publicly
read in the University of Dillingen in 1782, printed by authority, and dedicated
to Pius VI. At that time there were serious efforts making, in the
bosom of the church itself, to overthrow the rule of celibacy, and there was
no hesitation on the part of the ecclesiastical rulers to avow the full purport
of the Tridentine canons. Forster accordingly does not scruple to declare the
truth as to the orthodox doctrine, nor was exception taken to his assertion
by the authorities whose imprimatur the volume bears. The condemnation
of those, he says, who rashly assert that marriage can be contracted by those
in orders or bound by solemn vows of chastity is a dogma of faith, while the
definition that virginity is better than matrimony is a dogma of morals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_642">642</span>—“Pro
certo nos tenemus et ab omnibus Catholicis tenendum esse firmiter
adserimus, Ecclesiam in laudato consilio recte omnino definiisse ... melius
esse ac beatius manere in virginitate aut cœlibatu quam jungi matrimonio.
Recte porro damnasse eos qui matrimonium a clericis in SS. Ordinibus constitutis,
vel a regularibus castitatem solemniter professis, valide posse contrahi
temere adsererent. Et hoc ultimum ad Dogma Fidei, illud prius ad
Dogma Morum proculdubio pertinet” (op. cit. § xxxi. Dilingæ, 1782). In
full accordance with this was the line of argument adopted by the advocates
of the church in 1831, when it became necessary to overrule the decision
which had authorized the marriage of the priest Dumonteil. They represented
that to permit the civil marriage of a priest was, in fact, to persecute
the church, because “qui veut une religion la veut avec ses dogmes, et la
chasteté du prêtre est un de ceux de l’église Catholique” (Bouhier de
l’Écluse, de l’État du Prêtre en France, p. 31).</p>

<p>I do not doubt that the peculiar dialectics by which Bishop Dupanloup
explained away all that was shocking in the Syllabus of December, 1864
(La Convention et l’Encyclique, Paris, 1865), might make out a tolerably
fair line of argument to prove that the Tridentine fathers did not do what
they meant to do. In the subtle insincerity which pervades the formulas of
the Latin church, allowing either side of a question to be affirmed as opportunity
serves, the formulas of Trent constitute no exception. Thus if the
rule of celibacy were to be abrogated, I presume that it could be readily
accomplished by doing away with the vow of chastity and assuming that the
administering of that vow is merely a matter of discipline. The papal
power to dispense from vows is likewise too well established to be called in
question, as was shown by the decision of the council of Trent on that very
matter. The Latin church, in fact, has ample resources to enable it to adopt
any line of policy that its rulers may consider adapted to the exigencies of
the present or of the future; and if it should, at any time, consider sacerdotal
and cenobitic celibacy undesirable, I am perfectly willing to concede
that it would find no difficulty in setting aside or eluding the Tridentine
anathemas; yet none the less would those anathemas remain to show us
what was the position which it occupied in the sixteenth century. Meanwhile
it may be suggested to the orthodox who regard celibacy as merely disciplinary
that the church holds both marriage and ordination to be sacraments,
and that a definition that the two are incompatible and a decision
as to which of the two must give way to the other can hardly in the nature
of things, or by any rational use of language, be regarded as merely a matter
of discipline. Those, indeed, who are inclined to take such view, may well
bear in mind the fate of Panzini, who, regarding celibacy as a point of discipline,
was condemned, in 1860, by the Roman Inquisition to twelve years’
incarceration for merely writing an essay, which never was printed, arguing
in favor of its impolicy.</p>

<h2>WORKS BY THE SAME AUTHOR</h2>


<h3>STUDIES IN CHURCH HISTORY.</h3>

<p class="center">The Rise of the Temporal Power—Benefit of Clergy—Excommunication—The
Early Church and Slavery.</p>

<p class="center">Second edition, revised. In one large royal  12mo. volume of 603 pages.
Cloth, $2.50. Just issued.</p>


<p>No part of this learned and authoritative
work has escaped revision. The new matter
strengthens, illustrates more copiously, and
enlivens with anecdote the original argument,
and, by adducing modern instances,
brings the work up to date.—N. Y. <i>Nation</i>,
May  24, 1883.</p>

<p>The author is preëminently a scholar; he
takes up every topic allied with the leading
theme and traces it out to the minutest detail
with a wealth of knowledge and impartiality
of treatment that compel admiration.
The amount of information compressed
into the book is extraordinary, and
the profuse citation of authorities and references
makes the work particularly valuable
to the student who desires an exhaustive
review from original sources. In no other
single volume is the development of the
primitive church traced with so much clearness
and with so definite a perception of
complex or conflicting forces.—<i>Boston
Traveller</i>, May  3, 1883.</p>

<p>Mr. Lea is <i>facile princeps</i> among American
scholars in the history of the Middle
Ages, and, indeed, we know of no European
writer who has shown such research, accuracy,
and grasp in investigating important
and out-of-the-way topics connected with
the history of Europe in the Middle Ages.—N.
Y. <i>Times</i>, April  30, 1883.</p>

<p>It is some years since we read the first
edition of this work by Mr. Lea, and the
impression made by it on us at the time is
confirmed by reperusal of it in this enlarged
and improved form, namely, that it
is a book of great research and accuracy,
full of varied information on very interesting
phases of church life and history. It
discusses each subject with a rare fulness
of dates and instances, and a curious conscientiousness
of verification and citation
of authorities.—<i>Edinburgh Scotsman</i>, June
2, 1883.</p>




<h3>SUPERSTITION AND FORCE.</h3>

<p class="center">Essays on The Wager of Law, The Wager of Battle,
The Ordeal, and Torture.</p>

<p class="center">Third revised and enlarged edition. In one handsome royal 12mo. volume of
552 pages. Cloth $2.50.</p>


<p>This valuable work is in reality a history
of civilization as interpreted by the progress
of jurisprudence. In “Superstition
and Force” we have a philosophic survey
of the long period intervening between
primitive barbarity and civilized enlightenment.
There is not a chapter in the work
that should not be most carefully studied;
and, however well versed the reader may
be in the science of jurisprudence, he will
find much in Mr. Lea’s volume of which he
was previously ignorant. The book is a
valuable addition to the literature of social
science.—<i>Westminster Review</i>, Jan. 1880.</p>

<p>This is a book of extraordinary research.
Mr. Lea has entered into his subject <i>con
amore</i>, and a more striking record of the
cruel superstitions of our Middle Ages
could not possibly have been compiled.
As a work of curious enquiry into certain
outlying points of obsolete law, “Superstition
and Force” is one of the most remarkable
works we have met with.—<i>London
Athenæum</i>, November 3, 1866.</p>

<p>The appearance of a third edition of Mr.
Henry C. Lea’s “Superstition and Force”
is a sign that our highest scholarship is not
without honor in its native country.—N. Y.
<i>Nation</i>, August 1, 1878.</p>

<p>Mr. Lea’s curious historical monographs,
of which one of the most important is here
reproduced in an enlarged form, have given
him an unique position among English and
American scholars. He is distinguished
for his recondite and affluent learning, his
power of exhaustive historical analysis, the
breadth and accuracy of his researches
among the rarer sources of knowledge, the
gravity and temperance of his statements,
combined with singular earnestness of conviction,
and his warm attachment to the
cause of freedom and intellectual progress.—N.
Y. <i>Tribune</i>, August 9, 1878.</p>

So widely spread had these doctrines
become by the end of the second century
that Clement of Alexandria devotes
the third book of his Stromata to
their discussion and refutation. It is
not worth while to examine their peculiarities
minutely here. The curious
reader can find all that he is likely to
want concerning them in Irenæus, Hippolytus,
Clement, Epiphanius, and
Philastrius, without plunging further

Compare Beal’s “Romantic Legend
of Sakhya Buddha from the Chinese
Sanscrit,” pp. 33 sqq., with the Protevangelion,
the Gospel of the Infancy,
the Gospel of Nicodemus, etc.
</p>
<p>
Somewhat similar to the Buddhist
legend is the assertion of the Jainas
that their great Tirthankara, Mahavira,
selected the womb of Brahamani Devanandi,
wife of Rishabha Datta, as his
place of birth; but Sakra, indignant that
he should be born in the Brahman
caste, caused him to be transferred to
Trisala, wife of the Kshatriya Siddhartha
(Kalpa Sutra, Bk. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> ch. i. Stevenson’s
Translation, pp. 24, 38). Concerning
the comparative priority of
Jainism and Buddhism, see Thomas’s
“Jainism, or the early Faith of Asoka,”
London, 1877.
</p>
<p>
In this connection, it is perhaps worth
while to note the Mazdean belief in
Saoshyans, the future Messiah, who, as
in Judaism, is to overcome the evil
powers at the end of the world, and
preside over the resurrection of mankind,
and who is to be born of a virgin,
Eredhat Fedri. (Vendidad, Fargard
<span class="smcap lowercase">XIX.</span> 18; Bundehesh <span class="smcap lowercase">XXX.</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">XXXII.</span> 8, 9;
Haug’s Essays, Ed. 1878, pp. 313-14).
The mode of his conception as related
in the Bundehesh, may be compared
with the less decent speculations of Sanchez
as to that of Christ.</p></div>

The polygamy practised by the Jews
from the earliest times was continued
after the Dispersion. Justin Martyr
taxes them with it (Dial. cum Tryphone),
and Theodosius, in 393 endeavored
to suppress it (Const. 7 Cod. Lib.
<span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> Tit. ix.) by a law, the preservation of
which by Justinian, after an interval
of nearly a century and a half, shows
that the necessity for the prohibition
still existed. Even among some of the
eastern Christians the precept was required,
if we may believe some ancient
Arabic canons, which pass under the
name of the Council of Nicæa (Decret.
ex quatuor Regum libris can. v. <i>ap.</i>
Harduin. Concil. I. 511).
</p>
<p>
This explanation of St. Paul’s injunction
is adopted by Theophylact (Comment.
in I. Epist. ad Timoth.) and is
expressed in the paraphrase “non plures
habens uxores quam unam,” in a tract
of uncertain date, attributed to St.
Cyprian or St. Augustin (De <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>
Abusionibus Seculæ cap. x. <i>ap.</i> Opp. S.
Cypriani Mantissa p. 49, Oxon. 1682).
This is likewise the view put forward
by the Church of Geneva in 1563 when
replying to certain queries of the Huguenot
Synod of Lyons (Cap. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXI.</span> Art. x.
<i>ap.</i> Quick, Synodicon in Gall. Reform.
I. 49). Origen’s discussion of the matter
(Comment. in Matt. <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span> 23-4) shows
how doubtful he considered it.
</p>
<p>
In fact, if the text is to be construed
with rigorous exactness, it would exclude
all unmarried men from the episcopate,
and this seems to be the sense attributed
to it in the Apostolic Constitutions (Lib.
<span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> c. ii.), which in commenting upon
it do not appear to contemplate bachelors
as eligible.</p></div>

the twelfth century the canons were relaxed
by Clement III. in favor of a
priest of Ravenna whose ascetic ardor
had led him to follow the example of
Origen, and who was permitted to retain
all the functions of the priesthood
except the ministry of the altar (Can.
iv. Extra, I. <span class="smcap lowercase">XX.</span>). In the sixteenth century,
Ambrosio Morales, a Dominican,
took the same effectual means to extinguish
his passions and was in consequence
expelled from the Order, as required
by the canons. He betook himself
to literature and died in 1590 at
the age of sixty, while professor of
eloquence in the University of Alcalà
(De Thou, Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">XCIX.</span>). The practice
has perpetuated itself to the nineteenth
century in a Russian sect, which Catherine
II. and her successors endeavored
in vain to repress. In 1818 Alexander
II. ordered the enthusiasts banished to
Siberia, but the ardor with which they
courted martyrdom rendered their zeal
dangerously contagious and they were
left in obscurity, in the hope of their
dying out (Pluquet, Dict. des Hérésies,
s. v. <i>Mutilés de Russie</i>). This proved
equally ineffectual, for a recent traveller
describes them under the name of <i>Skopsis</i>
as a large tribe inhabiting the Caucasus,
where they flourish in spite of
the most energetic measures of repression
on the part of the government—imprisonment,
banishment to Siberia,
conscription, and even the death penalty
being powerless to overcome their
fanaticism (Brugsch, Reise der Preussischen
Gesandschaft nach Persien,
1860-1, <i>ap.</i> London Reader, Jan. 3,
1863). Buffon (Hist. Nat. de l’Homme,
<i>ap.</i> Helsen, Abus du Célibat des Prêtres,
p. 52) states that he was acquainted
with a priest who had adopted this mode
as the only one to preserve his virtue.</p></div>

The fiftieth canon was omitted by Dionysius Exiguus, but was subsequently
admitted by the church, notwithstanding that it proves in the clearest
manner the full enjoyment of marriage by all grades of the clergy. The
sixth canon (numbered fifth in the full collection) which prohibits the separation
of ecclesiastics from their wives, was likewise accepted, although in the
eighteenth century Cabassut stigmatizes it as heretical.</p></div>

I give the version of Dionysius
Exiguus: “Interdixit per omnia magna
synodus, non episcopo, non presbytero,
non diacono, nec alicui omnino qui in
clero est, licere subintroductam habere
mulierem; nisi forte matrem, aut sororem,
aut amitam, vel eas tantum personas
quæ suspiciones effugiunt.”
</p>
<p>
An Arabic version of the Nicene canons
specially limits the prohibition to
bishops, and to unmarried priests and
deacons.—“Decernimus ut episcopi non
habitent cum mulieribus.... Idem
decernitur de omni sacerdote cœlibe,
idemque de diaconis qui sine uxore
sunt.” (Harduin. Concil. I. 463.)—This
expresses nearly the discipline of
the Greek church.</p></div>

Baronius labors hard to break the

seem to me successfully controverted
by Calixtus. (De Conjug. Cleric. Ed.

Atton. Vercell. Epist. viii.—Epiphanius
(Hæres. <span class="smcap lowercase">LXXIX</span>) denies that
women had ever been permitted to rise
beyond the diaconate, and asserts that
their functions in that grade were
simply to render to women such offices
as decency forbade to men. In the

was prohibited by Concil. Arausican.

on account of disorders arising through
the fragility of the sex, as was perhaps
not unnatural, after the adoption of

women from teaching or asking questions

So great was the influx of wealth
to the church from the pious legacies of
the faithful that it became an evil of
magnitude to the state, and in 370 a
law of Valentinian pronounced null and
void all such testamentary provisions
made by those under priestly influence
(Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">XVI.</span> Cod. Theod. Tit. ii. l. 20)—a
provision repeated in 390 (Ibid. l. 27)
with such additional details as show its
successful evasion during the interval.

If all the postulates be granted, the
reasoning is unanswerable, and as the
precedents of the Old Testament have
been relied upon in all arguments since
the time of Siricius, it may be worth
while to refer to the caution of Ahimelech
before giving the shew-bread to
David (I. Sam. 21) as one of the texts
most constantly quoted, and to the residence
of Zacharias in the Temple during
his term of ministration (Luke <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>

These are certainly more germane to
the matter than the linen breeches provided

Tertullian has no scruple in asserting—“Et
Christum quidum virgo enixa
est, semel nuptura post partum.” (De
Monog. c. 8). This belief was founded
on the words of Matthew (<span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> 25), “καὶ
οὐκ ἐγίνωσκεν αὐτὴν ἔως ὁυ ἔτεκετον ὑιὸν
ἀυτῆς τὸν πρωτοτόκον, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα
ἀυτοῦ ἰησοῦν.”—“And he knew her not
till she had brought forth her first-born
son; and he called his name <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>.”
The restrictive “till” and the characterization
of Jesus as the first-born of
the Virgin (though the latter is omitted
in the Sinaitic and Vatican MSS.) are
certainly not easily explicable on any
other supposition; nor is the difficulty
lessened by the various explanations
concerning the family of Joseph, by
which such expressions as ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ
καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί αὐτοῦ—fratres et mater
ejus (Marc. <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> xxxi.), or the enumeration
of his brothers and sisters in Matt.
<span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span> 55-6, Mark <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span> 3, or the phrase
ἰάκωβον τὸν ἀδελφὸν τοῦ κυρίου—Jacobum
fratrem Domini (Galat. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> 19)—are taken
by commentators in a spiritual sense,
or are eluded by transferring to the
Greek a Hebrew idiom which confounds
brothers with cousins. In the Constitutiones
Apostolicæ occurs a passage—“Et
ego Jacobus frater quidem Christi
secundum carnem, servus autem tanquam
Dei”—which seems to place it in
an unmistakable light, if it be an extract
from some forgotten Gospel,
although it may only reflect the opinions
of the third century when the
collection was written or compiled.

The Bonosiacs were also sometimes
called Helvidians.—S. Augustin. de

</p>
<p>
In an age which was accustomed to
such arguments as “per mulierem culpa
successit, per virginem salus evenit”
(Rescript. Episcopp. ad Siricium), it is
easy to appreciate the pious horror
evoked by such blasphemous heresies.

<p>
St. Clement of Alexandria alludes to
a belief current in his day that after
the Nativity the Virgin had to submit
to an inspection <i>ab obstetrice</i> to prove
her purity (Stromat. Lib. vii.)—a story
which continued to trouble the orthodox
until the seventeenth century.

The Buddhists eluded all these troublesome
questions by making Queen Maya
die seven days after the birth of Sakyamuni,

Panar. Hæres. 78.—At the time of
the Reformation the Bonosiac heresy
naturally was revived. In 1523, at the
Diet of Nuremberg, the Papal orator
accused Osiander “quod prædicasset
Beatam Virginem Mariam post Christi
partum non mansisse Virginem” (Spalatini
Annal. ann. 1523), but Osiander
found few followers. At the Colloquy
of Poissy, in 1561 the learned Claude
d’Espense, doctor of Sorbonne, in arguing
that there were many things the
authority of which rested solely on
tradition, and yet which were admitted
as undoubted by all parties, instanced
“que la Vierge Marie demoura vierge
après l’enfantement, et plusieurs autres
semblables par conséquent; ce qui a
esté baillé de main en main par nos
pères, ores qu’il ne soit escript, n’est

It is generally assumed from this law

<p>
The councils thus alluded to are
probably the Roman Synods under
Damasus and Siricius.
</p>
<p>
I give the version most favored by
modern critics, but it should be observed
that there is doubt concerning
several important points. In the older
collections of councils (<i>e. g.</i> Surius,
Ed. 1567, T. I. p. 519-20) the canon
indicates no compulsion for the orders
beneath the diaconate, commencing
“Placuit episcopos et presbyteros et
diaconos” and ending “Cæteros autem
clericos ad hoc non cogi sed secundum
uniuscujusque ecclesiæ consuetudinem
observari debere,” and this has probability
in its favor, since the subdiaconate
was not included in the restriction for
nearly two centuries after this period,
and the lower grades were never subjected
to the rule.
</p>
<p>
The expression “secundum priora
statuta” is probably the emendation of
a copyist puzzled by the obscurity of
“secundum propria statuta,” which
latter is the reading given by Dionysius
Exiguus. That it is the correct
one is rendered almost certain by the
Greek version, which is κατα τους ἰδιους
ὁρους (Calixt. Conjug. Cleric, p. 350)
which would seem to leave the matter
very much to the preëxisting customs
of the individual churches.</p></div>

That strict rules were not enforced
in the African church is rendered
probable by another circumstance.
Faustus the Manichæan, in defending
the tenets of his sect on the subject
of marriage and celibacy, enters into
an elaborate comparison of their doctrines
and practices with those of the
Catholic church. In ridiculing the
idea that the Manichæans prohibited
marriage to their followers, he could
not have omitted the argument and
contrast derivable from prohibition
of marriage by the Catholics, had
such prohibition been enforced. His
omission to do this is therefore a
negative proof of great weight.—See

Whatever interest there might be
in exhibiting in detail the varying
legislation and the expedients of lenity
or severity by turns adopted, would
scarcely repay the space which it
would occupy or relieve the monotony
of retracing the circle in which the
unfortunate fathers of the church
perpetually moved. I therefore content
myself with simply indicating
such canons of the period as bear
upon the subject, for the benefit of
any student who may desire to examine
the matter more minutely.

The strictness with which the
Nicene canon was enforced is shown
by an epistle of St. Basil, about the
middle of the fourth century, in which
he sternly reproves a priest named
Paregorius, who at the age of 70 had
thought himself sufficiently protected
against scandal to allow to his infirmities
the comfort of a housekeeper. The
unlucky female is ordered to be forthwith
immured in a convent, and, until
this is accomplished, Paregorius is
forbidden to perform his priestly functions.
The whole is based on the authority
of the council of Nicæa.—“Nec
primo nec soli (tibi Paregori) sancivimus,
non debere mulierculas cohabitare
viris. Lege canonem, a sanctis
patribus nostris in Nicæna synodo
constitutum: qui manifeste interdixit,
ne quis mulierculam subintroductam
habeat. Cœlibatus autem honestatem
suam in eo habet, si quis a nexu mulieris
secesserit.”</p></div>

Quinisext. c. 33.—The Armenian
church in the middle ages, was excessively
severe as to the chastity of its
ministers. A postulant for orders was
obliged to confess, and if he had been
guilty of a single lapse, he was rejected.
So a priest in orders if yielding to the
weakness of the flesh out of wedlock
was expelled, though they were not
obliged to part with their wives, and
the Greek rule permitting marriage in
the lower orders was maintained.—Concil.

Leonis Novell. Constit. <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>—It is
not improbable that this custom resulted
from the iconoclastic schism of Leo the
Isaurian and Constantine Copronymus,
which occupied nearly the whole of the
eighth century. These emperors found
their most unyielding enemies in the
monks. In the savage persecutions
which disgraced the struggle, Constantine
endeavored to extirpate monachism
altogether. The accounts which his
adversaries have transmitted of the violence
and cruelties which he perpetrated
are doubtless exaggerated, but there is
likelihood that his efforts to discountenance
celibacy, as the foundation of the
obnoxious institution, are correctly
reported. “Publice defamavit et dehonestavit
habitum monachorum in
hippodromo, præcipiens unumquemque
monachum manutenere mulierem, et
taliter transire per hippodromum,
sumptis injuriis ab omni populo cumulatis”
(Baronii Annal. ann. 766, No.
1). He ejected the monks from the
monasteries, which he turned into
barracks; some of the monks were
tortured, others fled to the mountains
and deserts, where they suffered every
extremity, while others again succumbed
to threats and temptations, and were
publicly married—“alii corporeis voluptatibus
addicti, suas etiam uxores circumducere
non erubescebant” (Ibid.
No. 28, 29).</p></div>

I. Tim. v. 3-14. cf. Act. IX. 39-41.
In the time of Tertullian these women
were regularly ordained (Ad Uxor.
Lib. I. c. 7). This was forbidden by
the council of Nicæa (can. 19) and by
that of Laodicea (can. 11) in 372. In
451, however, we see by the council of
Chalcedon (can. 15) that the ancient
practice had been revived. The authorities
on the question will be found
very fully given by Chr. Lupus (Scholion
in Can. 15 Concil. Chalced.—Opp.
II. 90 sqq.). Even as late as the middle
of the ninth century stringent rules
were promulgated to punish the marriage
of deaconesses (Capitul. Add. III.
Cap. 75.—Baluz. I. 1191).</p></div>

(Harduin. I. 1775). This was not so

the widows immediately after the order
of deacons, and before the virgins.</p></div>

Nothing is so illogical as the logic
resorted to in order to prove foregone

texts Matt. <span class="smcap lowercase">XIX.</span> 12, Luke <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span> 33 and
Matt. <span class="smcap lowercase">XIX.</span> 21, 27, and then triumphantly

If further proof of this be required,
beyond what has already been incidentally
adduced, it is to be found in the
19th canon of the council of Ancyra,
held about the year 314. By this, the
vow of celibacy or virginity when
broken only rendered the offender incapable
of receiving holy orders. He
was to be treated as a “digamus,”
showing evidently that no punishment
was inflicted, beyond the disability
which attached to second marriages.
</p>
<p>
Even in the time of St. Augustin
monks were frequently married, as we
learn from his remarks concerning the
heretics who styled themselves Apostolici
and who gloried in their superior
asceticism—“eo quod in suam communionem
non reciperent utentes conjugibus
et res proprias possidentes; quales
habet Catholica [ecclesia] et monachos
et clericos plurimos.”—Augustin. de
Hæresib. No. <span class="smcap lowercase">XL.</span>
</p>
<p>
Even Epiphanius, the ardent admirer
of virginity, when controverting
the errors of the same sect, declares
that those who cannot persevere in their
vows had better marry and reconcile
themselves by penitence to the church
rather than to sin in secret—“Melius
est lapsum a cursu palam sibi uxorem
sumere secundum legem et a virginitate
multo tempore pœnitentiam agere et sic
rursus ad ecclesiam induci, etc.”—Panar.

latter is entitled to the credit of popularizing
the practice.—“Alii, autem, in

The lamentations of St. Cyprian
have already been alluded to. In 305
the council of Elvira found it necessary
to denounce perpetual excommunication
against the “virgines sacratæ” who
abandoned themselves to a life of licentiousness,
while those guilty only of a
single lapse were allowed restoration to
communion on the deathbed, if earned
by continual penitence (Concil. Eliberit.
c. 13).</p></div>

to the Mauritanian Bishops concerning
some virgins professed who had suffered
violence from the Barbarians. He decides
that they had committed no sin,
and could be admitted to communion if
they persevered in a life of chastity and
religious observance, but that they
could not continue to be numbered
with the holy maidens, while yet they
were not to be degraded to the order of
widows; and he further requires that
they shall exhibit their sense of shame
and humiliation. The problem evidently
was one which transcended the
acuteness even of Leo to solve—Leonis

St. Benedict of Nursia, the real

the wandering monks of his time:
“Tertium vero monachorum teterrimum
genus est Sarabaitarum ... qui
bini aut terni, aut certe singuli sine
pastore, non Dominicis sed suis inclusi
ovilibus, pro lege eis est desideriorum
voluptas; cum quidquid putaverint
vel elegerint, hoc dicunt sanctum, et
quod noluerint putant non licere.
Quartum vero genus est monachorum
quod nominatur gyrovagum, qui tota
vita sua per diversas provincias ternis
aut quaternis diebus per diversorum
cellas hospitantur, semper vagi et nunquam
stabiles, et propriis voluptatibus
et gulæ illecebris servientes, et per
omnia deteriores Sarabaitis: de quorum
omnium miserrima conversatione
melius est silere quam loqui.”—Regul.

Greg. Mag. Vit. S. Benedicti c. 2.—Juan
Cirita, a Spanish saint of the
twelfth century, was exposed to the
same temptation as St. Benedict, the
devil visiting him in the shape of a
lovely woman who sought refuge from
her pursuers in his cell. During a
sleepless night, feeling his resolution
giving way, he roused his fire and with
a glowing brand burned his arm to the
bone, whereupon the devil vanished,
loading him with reproaches (Henriquez
Vit. Joannis Cirita cap. ii.). Legends
of this nature are not uncommon,
nor are there wanting those of
another class in which the immediate
and visible agency of the Evil Spirit is
not called into play. Thus the holy
Godric, a Welsh saint of the twelfth
century, endeavored to subdue his
rebellious flesh in the manner which
St. Benedict found so effectual, but
without success. He then buried a
cask in the earthen floor of his cell,
filled it with water and fitted it with
a cover, and in this receptacle he shut
himself up whenever he felt the titillations
of desire. In this manner, varied
by occasionally passing the night
up to his chin in a river of which he
had broken the ice, he finally succeeded
in mastering his fiery nature.—Girald.

From such chance allusions as are
made by Gregory of Tours, this would
almost seem to be the general rule, and
not the exception. Thus he mentions
that Apollinaris obtained the see of
Rhodez at the solicitation of his wife
and sister (Hist. Franc. Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> c. 2),
and shortly afterwards the same episcopate
is filled by the appointment of
“Innocentius Gabalitanorum comes”
(Ibid. Lib. VI. c. 38). Sulpitius, when
nominated to that of Bourges, “ad
clericatum deductus, episcopatum ...
suscepit” (Ibid. Lib. VI. c. 39). Badegisilus,
Clotair’s mayor of the palace,
received the bishopric of Le Mans “qui
tonsuratus, gradus quos clerici sortiuntur
ascensus,” was duly installed (Ibid.
Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span> c. 9). Indeed, in his catalogue
of the Bishops of Tours, Gregory specifies
of Euphronius, the eighteenth
bishop, that he was “ab ineunte ætate
clericus,” showing how unusual it was
to be regularly bred to the church.</p></div>

Gregor. PP. I. Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span> Epist. 6.—This
rule had come to be very generally
neglected. The importance
attached to it, however, by strict disciplinarians
is well illustrated in the firmness
displayed by John, Patriarch of
Alexandria, a contemporary of Gregory,
whose bountiful charity had earned for
him the title of Eleemosynarius. In a
time of extreme famine, a wealthy
aspirant offered him 200,000 bushels of
corn and 100 pounds of gold for the
grade of deacon. He had unluckily
been twice married, and John refused
the dazzling bribe, although the episcopal
treasury had been exhausted in
relieving the necessities of the suffering
people (Thomassin, Discip. de l’Église,

Isidor Mercator also includes two
canons from the sixth century forgery
of the Roman Council said to have been
held under Silvester I. (see p. 122).
Of these, one prohibits bishops from
celebrating the marriage of nuns under
seventy years of age; the other forbids
priests from marrying, under a penalty
of ten year’s suspension, with a threat of
perpetual deprivation for contumacy.
(Constit. Pseudo-Silvestri cap. x. xix.)

</p>
<p>
He had previously (Epist. c. 12)
promulgated the prohibition, assigning
for it the more decent reason,
in imitation of St. Augustin, of the
danger arising from female attendants.
In this he was imitated, about 850, by
Rodolf of Bourges (Capit. Rodulf.
Bituricens. c. 16), and about 871 by
Walter of Orleans (Capit. Walteri
Aurelian. c. 3).
</p>
<p>
In 889, however, Riculfus of Soissons
declares the lamentable truth
without reserve: “Nos vero etiam a
matribus, amitis, sororibus vel propinquis
cavendum dicimus, ne forte
illud eveniat quod in sancta scriptura
legitur de Thamar sorore Absalon ...
de Loth etiam ... Quod si aliquis
vestrum matrem, sororem vel amitam
ad convescendum vocaverit, expleto
convivio ad domos suas vel ad hospitia

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_314_314" href="#FNanchor_314_314" class="label">314</a>
Thus the council of Mainz in 888—“Quod
multum dolendum est, sæpe
audivimus per illam concessionem plurima
scelera esse commissa, ita ut quidam
sacerdotum, cum propriis sororibus
concumbentes, filios ex eis generassent,
et idcirco constituit hæc sancta synodus,
ut nullus presbyter ullam feminam secum
in domo propria permittat quatenus
occasio malæ suspicionis vel
facti iniqui penitus auferatur” (Concil.
Mogunt. ann. 888 c. 10). In the
same year the third canon of the
council of Metz repeats the prohibition;
while in 895 the council of
Nantes declares—“Sed neque illas
quas canones concedunt; quia instigante
diabolo, etiam in illis scelus frequenter
perpetratum reperitur, aut
etiam in pedissequis illarum, scilicet
matrem, amitam, sororem.”—Concil.
Namnetens. ann. 895 c. 3.
</p>
<p>
It is true that some authorities,
including the great name of Pagi, attribute
to this council of Nantes the
date of 660, but this is unimportant
as regards the canon in question, for
its necessity during the period under
consideration is shown by its insertion
in the Capitularies of Benedict
the Levite (Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">VII</span>. c. 376), and in
the collection of Regino of Pruhm
(Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>. c. 104).</p></div>

St. Ulric is noteworthy as the first
subject of papal canonization, having
been enrolled in the calendar by the
council of Rome in 993. That priestly
marriage should be advocated by so
pious and venerable a father was of
course not agreeable to the sacerdotal
party, and his evidence against celibacy
has not infrequently been ruled
out of court by discrediting the authenticity
of the epistle. The compiler
of the collection containing it, made
in 1125, prefixed the name of Nicholas
as that of the pope to whom it was
addressed, and as St. Ulric was about
equidistant between Nicholas I. in the
ninth and Nicholas II. in the eleventh
century, it has been suggested that the
epistle was addressed to the latter, on
the occasion of his reforms in 1059
the use of St. Ulric’s name being assumed
as a mistake of the compiler.
That this is not so is shown by the
fact that already in 1079 it was known
as St. Ulric’s, being condemned as
such in that year by Gregory VII.—“scriptum
quod dicitur sancti Oudalrici
ad papam Nicholaum, de nuptiis
presbiterorum” (Bernald. Constant.
Chron. ann. 1079). The authenticity
of the document, I believe, is generally
admitted by unprejudiced critics.</p></div>

“Ad cumulum damnationis suæ,
accepit mulierem, nomine Hildeburgam,
in senectute, quæ, ingresso illo ad
se, concepit et peperit filios et filias,
&amp;c.” The chronicler makes the end of
this aged sinner an example of poetical
justice such as may frequently be found
in the monkish annals of those times—“Qui
dum esset flebotomatus, nocte
insecuta dormivit cum Episcopissa;
qua de re vulnus cœpit intumescere, et
dolor usque ad interiora cordis devenire.”
Finding his end approaching,
he assumed the monastic habit and took
the vows, after which he immediately
expired.—Act. Pontif. Cenoman. c. 29

Modern criticism has raised doubts
as to the existence of St. Patrick.
Whether they are well-grounded or not
is a matter of little importance here, as
we are concerned only with the institutions
bearing his name, which institutions
undoubtedly did exist. Meanwhile
I may add that few remote events
appear to rest on better authority than
the conversion of the Gaeidhil, about
the year 438, by a person known to his
contemporaries as Patraic, or Patricius;
and the name of Cain Patraic applied
to the secular code attributed to him,
dates from a very high antiquity.—See

tried his virtue by the same crucial experiments
as those resorted to by some
of the ardent devotees of the third
century, concealing his motive in order
that his humility might enjoy the
benefit of undeserved reprobation.
“Sancti Aldelmi Malmesburiensis, qui
inter duas puellas, unam ab uno latere,
alteram ab altero, singulis noctibus ut

cui nota fuerat conscientia ipsius et
continentia copiosius in futurum remuneraretur,
jacuisse describitur.”—Girald.

This demoralization of the nunneries
is not to be wondered at when Boniface,
in reproving Ethelbald, King of Mercia,
for his evil courses, could say, “Et
adhuc, quod pejus est, qui nobis narrant
adjiciunt: quod hoc scelus maxime
cum sanctis monialibus et sacratis
Deo virginibus per monasteria commissum
sit.” This sacrilegious licentiousness,
indeed, would seem almost to
have been habitual with the Anglo-Saxon
reguli for Boniface instances the
fate of Ethelbald’s predecessor Ceolred
and of Osred of Northumbria who had
both came to an untimely end in consequence
of indulgence in similar evil
courses.—Bonifacii Epist. 19.</p></div>

“Gif preorst ewenan forlæte and

translation of this “Si presbyter concubinam
suam dimiserit et aliam acceperit
anathema sit” (Concil. I. 498) is
perhaps hardly correct. Cwene can be
interpreted in either a good or a bad
sense, as a wife or a mistress; and the
terms of the law show that the connection
was a recognized one, the sin consisting
in disregarding it. If the priest’s
companion were only a concubine, his
guilt would not be measurably increased
by merely changing his unlawful consort.</p></div>

</p>
<p>
I give the translation of Spelman, as
being more faithful in spirit, although
less literal than that of Thorpe; for
though the expression “wifes gemanan”
may not be especially limited to wifely
relations, yet the whole tenor of the
passage shows that the women concerned
were not merely concubines, but
were entitled to the consideration of
legal wives.
</p>
<p>
The thane-right promised to those
who should reform their lives was one
of the recognized privileges of the
church. In a list of wer-gilds, anterior
to the period under consideration by
about a century, the wer-gild for the
priest—“mæsse-þegnes” is the same as
that for the secular noble—“woruld-þegnes”
(Thorpe, I. 187).</p></div>

“Munecas and mynecena canonicas
and nunnan” (Concil. Ænham. c.
1). Spelman thinks that the mynecena
were perhaps the wives or concubines
of monks (Concil. I. 530). Mynecen
is merely the feminine of munuc, a
monk; Thorpe translates it as “mynchens,”
and suggests that the “mynecena”
were merely the younger nuns,
not quite so strictly governed as the
elder “nunnan.” To this opinion Bosworth
(Dictionary, s. v. <i>nunne</i>) seems
to incline. It would appear to be so
from chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span> (be Mynecenan) of
the “Institutes of Polity” (Thorpe,
II. 322).</p></div>

Cnutes Domas c. v. (Thorpe, I.
362). To appreciate the full weight of
the privileges thus distributed, we should
bear in mind how completely, in those
times, the various classes of society
were distinguished by the facilities afforded
them of acquittal in cases of accusation,
and by the graduated scale of
fines established for injuries inflicted on
them. These were most substantial
advantages when the wer-gild, or blood-money,
was the only safeguard guaranteed
by law for life and limb, and were
most important privileges of the aristocracy.
This constitutes the thane-right
alluded to in the council of Enham,
and retained by the laws of Cnut, as
attaching to priests who preserve their
chastity. Thus “sacramentum presbyteri
regulariter viventis tantumdem
valeat sicut liberalis hominis” (Cnuti
Leg. Sæcul. c. 128—ed. Kolderup-Rosenvinge)—the
expression “liberalis
homo” being, in this version, used for
the “taynus” or thane of the other
texts.</p></div>

Perhaps as suggestive an illustration
of the morals and manners of the age
as can well be given is afforded by a
deed executed in 1055 by a noble count
of Catalonia on the occasion of his
marriage. He pledges himself not to
cast off his bride, except for infidelity—such
infidelity not being plotted for
by him—and to secure the performance
of this promise he places in the hands
of his father-in-law four castles, to be
held in pledge, subject to forfeiture in
case of his violating the agreement.

Learning, on his death-bed, that he
was not to be buried as a pope, he requested
the prelates around him to place
his coffin at the church-door securely
fastened, and if the portals opened

It was done, when a gust of wind burst

The world can never know the long
and silent suffering endured in the terrible
self-combat of ardent natures in
the solitude of the cloister. If many
succumb, the indignation which Damiani
and his class so freely bestow on
the victims should be transferred rather
to the system which produces them.
A monk of the period has left us a vivid
and curious picture of his own tortures
in the endless struggle with the tempter;
and the mental torments to which his
fellow-unfortunates were exposed are
aptly condensed in the simple tale of
the Abbess Sarah, who for thirteen long
years maintained her ground without
shrinking from the ceaseless assaults of
the enemy by continually invoking the
aid of God—“Da mihi fortitudinem
Deus!” (Othlon. de Tentat. suis P. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>).
The hagiology of the church is full
of legends, more or less veritable, of
the sufferings of these martyrs and of
their triumphs over the flesh, from the
time of St. Ammonius, who, when less
decisive measures failed, bored his flesh
in many places with red-hot iron, and
thus vanquished passion by suffering.
A collection of these stories, more
curious than decent, may be found
admiringly detailed by Giraldus Cambrensis
in his Gemma Ecclesiastica,

How utterly this was opposed to
the received dogmas and practice of the
church can be seen from the decision of
Nicholas I. on the same question—“Sciscitantibus
vobis, si a sacerdote,
qui sive comprehensus est in adulterio,
sive de hoc fama sola respersus est,
debeatis communionem suscipere, necne,
respondemus: Non potest aliquis quantumcumque
pollutus sit, sacramenta
divina polluere, quæ purgatoria cunctarum
remedia contagionum existunt....
Sumite, igitur, intrepide ab omni
sacerdote Christi mysteria, quoniam
omnia in fide purgantur” (Nicolai I.
Epist. <span class="smcap lowercase">XCVII.</span> c. 71). See also a
similar decision in 727 by Gregory II.
(Bonifacii Epist. <span class="smcap lowercase">CXXVI.</span>).
</p>
<p>
The only adverse authority of this
period that I have met with is the
Penitential of Theodore of Canterbury,
already referred to, prescribing rebaptism
for those baptized by priests of known
unchastity (Lib. II. cap. ii. § 12.—Haddan
&amp; Stubbs’s Councils, III. 192).
</p>
<p>
Damiani saw the danger to which a
practice such as this exposed the church,
and lifted up his voice to prevent the
evil results—

</div></div></div>

<p>
and when, about the year 1060, the
Florentines refused the ministrations of
their bishop, whom they were determined
from other causes to eject, he
reproved them warmly, adducing the
only reasonable view of the question,
“quod Spiritus Sanctus per improbi
ministerium dare potest sua charismata”
(Opusc. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXX.</span> c. 2).
</p>
<p>
Simoniacal priests as well as concubinary
ones were included in the ban,
and when, in 1049, Leo IX. commenced
his vigorous persecution of simony,
there arose a belief that ordination
received at hands tainted with that sin
was null and void. This was promptly
stigmatized as a heresy, and Damiani’s
untiring pen was employed in combating
it. He argued the question very
thoroughly and keenly when it was
under debate by a synod, and succeeded
in procuring its condemnation (Opusc.
<span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span> c. 12).
</p>
<p>
The prohibition, first proclaimed by
Nicholas II. and finally enforced by
Gregory VII., caused no little trouble
in the church. Towards the close of
the century, Urban II. found himself
obliged to discuss the question, and in
an epistle to Lucius, provost of the
church of St. Juventius at Pavia, he
admits that the sacraments administered
by guilty priests are uncorrupted, yet
he approves of their rejection in order
to stimulate the clergy to virtue, and
even declares that those who receive
them, except under instant and pressing
necessity, are guilty of idolatry (“nisi
forte sola morte interveniente, utpote
ne sine baptismate vel communione
quilibet humanis rebus excedat; eis,
inquam, in tantum obsunt, ut veri
idolatræ sint”—Urbani II. Epist. 273)—a
decision the logic of which is not
readily apprehended. St. Anselm of
Canterbury assents to the doctrine, but
places it in a more reasonable and practical
shape—“non quo quis ea quæ
tractent contemnenda, sed tractantes
execrandos existimet” (Epist. <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>).
The consequences of such a system,
however, if strictly carried out, would
have been most disastrous to the church,
and when the zeal of Hildebrand became
forgotten his injunctions were
overruled. The century was scarcely
out before Honorius of Autun maintained
most positively that Christ operates
through the hands of the vilest as
well as of the most holy ministers, provided
only they are orthodox in faith
(Eucharistion c. vi.—Pez, Thesaur.
II. i. 355). About 1150, however,
Geroch of Reichersperg declares that he
considered Gregory’s commands as still
in force, and that he paid no more attention
to the masses of concubinary
priests than if they were so many
Pagans (Gerhohi Dial. de Differentia
Cleri—Pez, Thesaur. II. ii. 463). Yet
before the end of the twelfth century,
Lucius III. had returned to the policy
of Nicholas I.—“Sumite ergo ab omni
sacerdote intrepide Christi mysteria,
quia omnia in fide Christi purgantur”
(Post Lateran. Concil. P. <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span> c. 38), the
positiveness of which was not much
affected by the subtle distinctions which
he endeavored to draw between crimes
notorious and tolerated. Yet St. Thomas
Aquinas, on the other hand, affirmed
that it was a mortal sin to assist at the
Mass celebrated by a priest who was
notoriously unchaste (Pontas, Dict. de
Cas de Conscience II. 1445). The
church, however, gradually returned to
the old doctrine and practice. The
policy of Gregory was condemned as
a heresy when adopted by the followers
of Arnold of Brescia (Bonacursi Vit.
Hæreticorum—D’Achery I. 214) and
an austere priest, Albero of Mercke,
near Cologne, who taught it was
promptly silenced (Anon. adv. Alberonis
errores—Martene Ampl. Coll. IX.
1251). In 1292 the council of Aschaffenburg
anathematized those who
“præsumptione dampnabili” taught
the heresy that priests in mortal sin
could not perform the sacred mysteries,
and it decided “licite ergo a quocumque
sacerdote ab ecclesia tolerato, divina
mysteria audiantur et alia recipiantur
ecclesiastica sacramenta” (Concil.
Schafnaburg. ann. 1292 can. i.—Hartzheim
IV. 7). And when Wickliffe
and Huss undertook to carry out
the dicta of Nicholas II. and Gregory
VII. to their legitimate conclusions,
the policy was at once recognized as a
heresy of the worst character and most
destructive consequence. Thus in 1491 a
Synod of Bamberg condemns as heretics
those who refuse to receive the ministrations
of sinful priests.—Synod.
Bamberg. ann. 1491 Tit. xliv. (Ludewig.
Script. Rer. German. I. 1241-2).</p></div>

</p>
<p>
It is evident here that the opprobrious
epithet “concubine” is applied
to those who were as legally wives as it
was possible to make them. Damiani,
indeed, admits it, and even intimates
that concubine was too honorable a
word to be applied to the wives of
priests—“Illorum vero clericorum feminas,
qui matrimonia nequeunt legali
jure contrahere, non conjuges sed concubinas
potius, sive prostibula congrue
possumus appellare” (Opusc. <span class="smcap lowercase">XVIII.</span>
Diss. iii. c. 2). After this period it will
be found that the wives of priests were
rarely dignified with the title of “uxores,”
although ordination was not yet
an impediment destructive of marriage.
</p>
<p>
It is as well to observe here that at
this period and for some time later the
position of the concubine had not the
odium attaching to it by modern manners,
and this should be borne in mind
when reviewing the morals of the Middle
Ages. The connection was a recognized
and almost a legal one, following
the traditions of the Roman law,
by which it was legitimate and permanent,
so long as the parties respectively
remained unmarried. A man could
not have a wife and concubine at the
same time (Pauli Sentent. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> 20), nor
could he legally have two concubines
together (Novel. <span class="smcap lowercase">XVIII.</span> c. 5). Not
only were such regulations thus promulgated
by Christian emperors, but
the relationship was duly recognized
by the Christian church. The first
council of Toledo, in 398, enjoined
upon the faithful “tantum aut unius
mulieris, aut uxoris aut concubinæ, ut
ei placuerit, sit conjunctione contentus”
(Concil. Toletan. I. c. 17), showing
that either connection apparently was
legitimate, and this is quoted at the
commencement of the tenth century,
as still in force, by Regino (De Discip.
Eccles. Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> c. 100). A half century
later, about 450, Leo I. was actually
appealed to to decide whether a man
who quitted a concubine and took a
wife committed bigamy—which Leo
reasonably enough answered in the
negative (Leon. Epist. <span class="smcap lowercase">XC.</span> c. 5). The
principle of the Roman law was still
the rule of the church in the 9th century,
for a Roman synod held by
Eugenius II. in 826 declared “Ut non
liceat uno tempore duas habere uxores,
uxoremve et concubinam. De
illo vero qui cum uxore concubinam
habet, præcipit, ut si admonitus eam
a se abjicere noluerit, communione
privetur.” (Pertz, Legum T. II. P. ii.
p. 12.) The view entertained of the
matter at the time under consideration
may be gathered from a canon of the
councils of Rome, in 1052 and 1063,
suspending from communion the layman
who had a wife and concubine at
the same time (Concil. Roman. ann.
1059 c. 12: ann. 1063 c. 10)—whence
we may deduce that a concubine alone
was hardly considered irregular. During
the latter part of the succeeding
century we find the concubine a recognized institution in Scotland, for the
laws of William the Lion, after stating
that the wife was not bound to reveal
the crimes of her husband, adds “De
concubina vero et de familia domus
non est ita; quia ipsi tenentur revelare
maleficia magistri sui, aut debent a
servitio suo recedere” (Statut. Willelmi
c. <span class="smcap lowercase">XIX.</span> § 9). In England, late
in the thirteenth century, Bracton
speaks of the “concubina legitima” as
entitled to certain rights and consideration
(Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> Tract. ii. c. 28 § 1, and
Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span> Tract. vi. c. 8 § 4). In Spain,
at the same period, the son of an unmarried
noble by a concubine, was
noble (Juan Perez de Lara, in Arch.
Seld. 130, Bib. Bodl.), and in the Danish
code of Waldemar II., which was
in force from 1280 to 1683, there is a
provision that a concubine kept openly
for three years shall be held to be a
legitimate and legal wife (Leg. Cimbric.
Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> cap. xxvii. Ed. Ancher); while
the elaborate provisions for the division
of estates between legitimate and illegitimate
children, contained in the code
compiled by Andreas Archbishop of
Lunden, in the 13th century, show that
certain legal rights were recognized in
the latter (Legg. Scan. Provin. Ed.
Thorsen pp. 110-2). Indeed, in the
Norwegian law of that period, when the
king left no legitimate sons the crown
descended to illegitimates (Jarnsida,
Kristendoms-Balkr, c. <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>). In Bigorre,
concubines, under the name of
<i>Massipia</i>, were recognized by law, and
formal notarial contracts were drawn
up, as late as the close of the fifteenth
century, specifying the price to be paid
and the duration of the connection;
and when the man was already married
he sometimes engaged to marry the
<i>massipia</i> in case of his wife’s death
during the term (Lagrèze, Hist. du
Droit dans les Pyrénées, Paris, 1867,
p. 377). We must therefore bear in
mind that, until the rule of sacerdotal
celibacy became rigorously enforced,
the “concubina” of the canons generally
means a wife, and that for some
time afterwards the concubine was by
no means necessarily the shameless
woman implied under the modern acceptation
of the term.</p></div>

In 1060, Cardinal Humbert of
Silva-Candida, in combating the prevailing
vice of simony, made use of
this argument, reasoning that an immoral
priest may be suspended or may
be tolerated in hope of amendment,
but if he trenches on heresy, there can
be neither hope nor mercy for him
(Humbert. Cardinal. adv. Simoniac.
Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> c. 43). Damiani applied this
to the defenders of marriage with all
his vigor. “Qui nimirum dum corruunt,
impudici; dum defendere nituntur,
merito judicantur hæretici”
(Opusc. <span class="smcap lowercase">XVIII.</span> Diss. ii. c. 8). “Nam
cum peccat homo, quasi in puteum
labitur; cum vero peccata defendit,
os putei super eum, ne pateat egressus,
urgetur ... Hoc autem inter peccatorem
et hæreticum distat: quia peccator
est qui delinquit, hæreticus autem qui
peccatum per pravum dogma defendit”

Alex. II. Epist. 125.—Batthyani
(Leg. Eccles. Hungar. I. 407) remarks
that this lenity arose from the fact that
otherwise divine service would have
ceased—“omnes ecclesiæ a divinis officiis
vacassent.”
</p>
<p>
It is also observable that subdeacons
are not included in this prohibition—a
remarkable exemption, since by this
time their subjection to the law of
celibacy had become a settled rule in
the Roman church. I may here remark
that I had collected considerable
material to trace the varying practice
with regard to the subdiaconate, but as
it involves no principle, merely depending
in earlier times upon the local custom
as to the functions of that grade,
the discussion would scarcely repay the
space that it would occupy.</p></div>

The contrast between the weakness
of Alexander and the unbending rigidity
of his successor, Hildebrand,
is well shown by comparing this unlimited
acceptance of priestly offspring
with the refusal of the latter to permit
the elevation of a clerk requested by
both his bishop and the King of Aragon,
simply because he was illegitimate,
although in other respects admitted
to be unexceptionable (Gregor. VII.
Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> Epist. 50). We have already
seen that even amid the license which
prevailed during the early part of the
century, some German bishops habitually
refused orders to the sons of
priests.</p></div>

I think that there is too much concurrent
testimony to this effect to admit
a reasonable doubt that the Albigenses
were Manichæans. I may return to
them hereafter, and therefore will not
discuss the point here. As regards the
earlier heretics, however, I may mention
the following contemporary authorities:—
</p>
<p>
With respect to those of Toulouse
and Orleans, the “Fragmentum Historiæ
Aquitaniæ” (Pithœi Hist. Franc.
Script. p. 82) says: “Eo tempore
decem ex canonicis sanctæ crucis
Aurelianis probati sunt esse Manichæi,
quos rex Robertus quum nollent
ad Catholicam converti fidem, igne cremari
jussit. Simili modo apud Tholosam
inventi sunt Manichæi, et ipsi igne
cremati sunt: et per diversas Occidentis
partes Manichæi exorti per latibula sese
occultare cœperunt”—and their errors
are thus specified in the “Fragmentum
Hist. Franc.” (Op. cit. p. 84) “Ii
dicebant non posse aliquem in baptismate
spiritum sanctum suscipere, et
post criminale peccatum veniam non
promereri; impositionem manuum nihil
posse conferre; nuptias spernebant;
episcopum affirmabant non posse ordinare,
&amp;c.”
</p>
<p>
In the Artesian synod, held in 1025
to condemn those of Cambrai, the
tenth canon is directed against their
hostility to marriage (Labbei et Coleti
XI. 1177-8).—See also the prefatory
letter of Gerard, Bishop of Cambrai—“Conjugatos
nequaquam ad regnum
pertinere”—(Hartzheim Concil. German.
III. 68).
</p>
<p>
Concerning those executed at Goslar
in 1052—“Ibique quosdam hæreticos,
inter alia pravi erroris dogmata
Manichæa secta omnis esum animalis
exsecrantes, consensu cunctorum, ne
hæretica scabies latius serpens plures
inficeret, in patibulis suspendi jussit.”—Herman.
Contract. ann. 1052.
</p>
<p>
About 1100 Radolphus Ardens describes
the Manichæans who infested
the territory of Agen, and recapitulates
their doctrines as embracing dualism,
abhorrence of animal food and of marriage,
rejection of the Old Testament
and part of the New, disbelief in the
Eucharist, in baptism and resurrection,
&amp;c.—“Dicunt enim tantum flagitium
esse accedere ad uxorem, quantum ad
matrem vel ad filiam”—Radulf. Ardent.
T. I. P. ii. Homil. 19.
</p>
<p>
The council of Toulouse, held by
Calixtus II. in 1119, adopted a canon
condemning those who objected to the
Eucharist, priesthood, and legitimate
marriage, showing that Manichæism
was unextinguished in Languedoc.—Udalr.
Babenb. Cod. Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> c. 303.
</p>
<p>
In 1146 a synod at Cologne tried
certain heretics, but before the examination
was concluded the unfortunates
were seized by the rabble and
burned “et quod magis mirabile est,
ipsi tormentum ignis non solum cum
patientia, sed et cum lætitia introierunt
et sustinuerunt.” Their Manichæism
is manifested by their tenets concerning
marriage—“De baptismo nostro non
curant: Nuptias damnant.... In
cibis suis vetant omne genus lactis, et
quod inde conficitur, et quidquid ex
coitu procreatur”—Narratio Everwini
Præpositi (Hartzheim. III. 353-4).
Cf. Bernardi Serm. 65, 66, in Cantica.
</p>
<p>
The accusations so freely disseminated
against them for the purpose of
stirring up popular indignation—such
as that in their conventicles, after religious
exercises, the lights were extinguished,
and the congregation abandoned
themselves to indiscriminate
excesses—are, of course, without foundation.
It is instructive to observe
that precisely the same scandals were
asserted of the early Christians (Tertull.
Apologet. c. vii.)—so little does human
nature change with the lapse of centuries.</p></div>

It is scarcely worth while to more
than refer to the assertion of mediæval
Milanese chroniclers that Eriberto married
a noble lady named Useria. Puricelli
(Muratori Script. Rer. Ital. V.
122-3) has sufficiently demonstrated
its improbability. He does not, however,
allude to the argument derivable
from the fact that Eriberto’s name is
signed to the proceedings of the council
of Pavia in 1022, where priestly marriage
was so severely condemned.</p></div>

The writer was a partisan of the
married clergy; but his description is
confirmed by the testimony which
Damiani bears (ante, p. 203) to the
good character of the married clergy
of Savoy. Still, there may be some
truth in the counter statement of an
opponent, S. Andrea of Vallombrosa,
a disciple of S. Arialdo—“Nam alii
cum canibus et accipitribus huc
illucque pervagantes, suum venationi
lubricæ famulatum tradebant; alii
vero tabernarii et nequam villici, alii
impii usurarii existebant; cuncti fere

Universi sic sub simoniaca hæresi

c. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> No. 7.
</p>
<p>
The Milanese defended their position
not only by Scripture texts, but also by
a decision which they affirmed was
rendered by St. Ambrose, to whom the
question of the permissibility of sacerdotal
marriage had been referred by the
pope and bishops. Of course the story
was without foundation, but singularly
enough, the Milanese clung to it long
after the subject had ceased to be open
to discussion. Puricelli has investigated
the matter with his usual conscientious
industry, and shows the repetition
of the legend not only by Datius
and Landulfus Senior in the eleventh
century, but by Gualvaneo Flamma in
the thirteenth, by the author of the
Flos Florum, by Pietro Agario and by
Bernardino Corio in the fifteenth, and
by Tristano Calco in the sixteenth century—the
two latter falling in consequence
under the revision of the Index.

Milan long retained its bad preeminence
as a nest of heresy. When
Frederic II., in 1236, delayed his promised
crusade to subdue the rebellious
Milanese, his excuse to the pope was
that he ought not to leave behind him
unbelievers worse than those whom he
would seek across the seas. “Cum
... jam zizania segetes incipiant suffocare
per civitates Italicas, præcipue
Mediolanensium, transire ad Saracenos
hostiliter expugnandos, et illos incorrectos
pertransire, esset vulnus infixo

et cicatricem deformam non medelam
procurare,” and Matthew Paris calls
Milan “omnium hæreticorum, Paterinorum,
Luciferanorum, Publicanorum,
Albigensium, Usurariorum refugium
ac receptaculum.”—Hist. Angl.

Benzo, the uncompromising imperialist,

obtained. He accuses Anselmo di

To this period may probably be attributed

(Epistt. 93, 94) to the clergy and people

Roman synod had recently prohibited
incontinent priests from officiating, and
had ordered the people not to attend at

to Paris in mistake for the relics of St.
Denis the Areopagite, the Parisians in
his time still venerating them as those

</p>
<p>
About the time of Arialdo’s martyrdom,
Cremona must have been won
over to the cause of the reformers, for
in 1066 we find Alexander II. addressing
the “religiosis clericis et fidelibus
laicis” of that city, thanking God that
they had been moved to extirpate the
simoniacal and Nicolitan heresies, and
commanding that in future all those in

The fanciful purity which came to
be considered requisite to the episcopal
office is well illustrated by the case of
Faricius, Abbot of Abingdon, who was
elected to the see of Canterbury. His
suffragans refused his consecration because
he was a skilful leech—“tunc
electus est Faricius ad archiepiscopatum,
sed episcopus Lincolniensis et
episcopus Salesburiensis obstiterunt, dicentes
non debere archiepiscopum
urinas mulierum inspicere” (De Abbat.
Abbendon.—Chron. Abingdon. II.
287). The prejudice against the practice
of physic as incompatible with the
purity of an ecclesiastic was wide-spread
and long-lived, as chronicled in
the canons of numerous councils prohibiting
it (e. g. Concil. Claromont.
ann. 1130 c. 5)—but it was not always
so. In 998 Theodatus, a monk of
Corvey, received the bishopric of
Prague from Otho III., as a reward for
curing Boleslas I., Duke of Bohemia,
of paralysis, by means of a bath of
wine, herbs, spices, and three living
black puppies four weeks old (Paulini
Dissert. Hist. p. 198); and about the
year 1200, Hubert Walter, Archbishop
of Canterbury, bestowed the see of St.
David’s on Geoffrey, Prior of Llanthony,
his physician, whose skill had won his

who promulgated the canon in a national
council; and the next year he
followed this up by a legation empowered
to forbid the laity from
attending the offices of married priests.

An encyclical letter of Siegfrid, in
1075, states that Gregory had sent to
his diocese commissioners to reform the
immorality of the clergy, and that they
had labored earnestly, but fruitlessly,
to accomplish the task by a liberal use
of suspension and excommunication.
He had thereupon reported to the pope
the scandal and infamy of his church,
when Gregory, considering the multitude
of the transgressors, counselled
moderation. Siegfrid therefore orders
all incorrigible offenders to be suspended
and sent to him for judgment.
(Hartzheim Concil. German. III.
175.)—Hartzheim also (III. 749) gives,
under date of 1077, another letter from
Siegfrid to Gregory, in which he promises
to do his best in reforming the
clergy, but advises moderation towards
those whose weakness merits compassion.</p></div>

According to Conrad of Ursperg
(Chron. ann. 1080) among the reasons
adduced for the deposition of Gregory
the synod of Brixen, was “Qui
inter concordes seminavit discordiam,
inter pacificos lites, inter fratres scandala,
<i>inter conjuges divortia</i>, et quicquid
quiete inter pie viventes stare
videbatur, concussit”—in which the
words italicized may possibly allude
to the separation of the married
clergy. Conrad, however, was a compiler
of the thirteenth century, and
his statements are not to be received
without caution. If this motive had
its weight with the prelates of the
synod, they did not care to publish it
to the world, for there is no allusion
to it in the letter of renunciation addressed
by them to Gregory (Goldast.
Const. Imp. I. 238)—forming a striking
contrast to the proceedings of the
synod of Pavia in 1076, already alluded
to.</p></div>

I do not remember to have met with
any contemporary authority for this
assertion, nor is there any provision
of this nature in the decrees of the
Diet as given by Goldastus (I. 245);
but the chroniclers of the period were
generally papalists, and would be apt
to omit recording anything which they
would deem so creditable to their adversaries.
Yet that the imperialists
were no longer held responsible for
clerical irregularities is evident from
a letter written in 1090 by Stephen,
the papalist Bishop of Halberstadt, to
Waltram of Magdeburg, who was a
follower of Henry. In all his violent
invectives against the imperialists,
and in his long catalogue of their
sins, he makes no allusion to priestly
incontinence, showing that they must
have disavowed these irregularities so
formally as to leave no ground for imputations
of complicity (Dodechini
Append. ad Mar. Scot. ann. 1090).</p></div>

See the confirmation of excommunication
in which St. Anselm exhaled
his fiery indignation at those
who continued with “bestiali insania”
to defy the authorities of the church.
(Anselmi Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> Epist. 112.)

<p>
Anselm was not entirely without
assistance in his efforts. One of his
monks, Reginald, of the great monastery
of Canterbury, wrote a fearfully
diffuse paraphrase, in Leonine verse,
of the life of St. Malchus. It was an
evil-minded generation, indeed, that
could resist such a denunciation of marriage
as that pronounced by the saint—

Perhaps it is to John’s experience in
this matter that may be attributed the
fact that when, in 1214, he entered into
a league with his knight-errant nephew,
the Emperor Otho IV., against Philip
Augustus, they also declared war against
Innocent III., and proposed to carry
out a gigantic scheme of spoliation by
enriching, from ecclesiastical property,
all who might rally to their standard.
They proclaimed their intention of
humbling the church, reducing the
numbers of the clergy, stripping those
who were left of all their temporalities,
and leaving them only moderate stipends.
Both John and Otho had been under excommunication, and could
speak feelingly of the overweening
power and abuses of the church, whose
members they characterize as “genus
hoc pigrum et fruges consumere natum,
quod otia ducit, quodque sub tecto
marcet et umbra, qui frustra vivunt,
quorum omnis labor in hoc est, ut
Baccho Venerique vacent, quibus crapula
obesis poris colla inflat, ventresque
abdomine onerat.” (Lünig. Cod. Diplom.
Italiæ I. 34). A few weeks later
the Bridge of Bouvines put a sudden
end to this prosperous plan of reformation.</p></div>

Filius autem, more sacerdotum

Specul. Eccles. Dist. iii. c. 8. (Girald.
Opp. III. 129.) However Giraldus and
the severer churchmen might stigmatize
these companions as concubines,
they were evidently united in the
bonds of matrimony. He says himself,
respecting Wales, “Nosse te novi
... canonicos Menevenses fere cunctos,
maxime vero Walensicos, publicos fornicarios
et concubinarios esse, sub alis
ecclesiæ cathedralis et tanquam in ipso
ejusdem gremio focarias suas cum obstetricibus
et nutricibus atque cunabulis
in laribus et penetralibus exhibentes....
Adeo quidem ut sicut patres eorum
ipsos ibi genuerunt et promoverunt, sic
et ipsi more consimili prolem ibidem
suscitant, tam in vitiis sibi quam beneficiis
succedaneam. Filiis namque suis
statim cum adulti fuerint et plene pubertatis
annos excesserint, concanonicorum
suorum filias, ut sic firmiori
fœdere sanguinis scilicet et affinitatis
jure jungantur, <i>quasi maritali copula
dari procurant</i>. Postmodum autem
... canonicas suas filiis suis conferri
per cessionem non inefficaciter elaborant.”
(De Jure et Statu Menev.
Eccles. Dist. i.) That this condition
of affairs was not confined to the
canons of cathedral churches is evident
from his general remarks in the
Gemm. Eccles. Dist. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> cap. xxiii.

His treatise De Statu Menevens.

This Boniface was brother of the
Duke of Savoy, and was one of the
Italian prelates whose intrusion into
the choice places of the Anglican
church was a source of intense irritation.
The career of another brother,
Philip, is an instructive illustration
of the ecclesiastical manners of the
age. He was in deacon’s orders, and
yet, as a leader of condottieri, he was
a strenuous supporter of Innocent IV.
in his quarrel with Frederic II. He
was created Archbishop of Lyons,
Bishop of Valence, Provost of Bruges,
and Dean of Vienne, and, after enjoying
these miscellaneous dignities for
some twenty years, when at length
Clement IV. insisted on his ordination
and consecration, he threw off his episcopal
robe, married first the heiress of
Franche-Comté and then a niece of
Innocent IV.—dying at last as Duke
of Savoy (Milman, Latin Christ. IV.
326).

The canon law maintained the
extraordinary doctrine that the confession
of the guilty woman could not
be received as evidence against her
accomplice, though it was good as
against herself. “Unde nec sacerdotes
accusare nec in eos testificari valent....
Quia ergo ista de se confitetur,
super alienum crimen ei credi non
oportet; sed contra eam sua confessio
interpretanda est” (Gratian. P. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>

imagine a rule of practice better fitted
to repress investigation and to shield
offenders.</p></div>

Lanfranci Epistt. 37, 38.—Bernardi
Vit. S. Malachiæ cap. iii. viii.—The
rudeness of the age may be measured
by the fact that when Malachi determined
to adorn the venerable monastery
of Benchor with an oratory of
stone such as he had seen abroad, the
mere laying of the foundations aroused
the wonderment of the people, to whom
buildings of that kind were unknown—“quod
in terra illa necdum ejusmodi
ædificia invenirentur”—and his enemies
took advantage of the feeling to
interfere with the work on the ground
that such an enterprise was unheard of,
and that so stupendous an undertaking
could never be accomplished. This
piece of presumption was promptly rebuked
by the death of the ringleader,
and by the finding in the excavations
of a treasure which enabled St. Malachi
to execute his plans (Vit. S. Malach.
c. xxviii.). St. Bernard, who derived his impressions from Malachi and his
companions, thus describes the Irish of
Connaught, “sic protervos ad mores,
sic ferales ad ritus, sic ad fidem impios,
ad leges barbaros, cervicosos ad disciplinam,
spurcos ad vitam. Christiani
nomine, re pagani. Non decimas, non
primitias dare, non legitima inire conjugia,
non facere confessiones; pœnitentias
nec qui peteret, nec qui daret
penitus invenire. Ministri altaris pauci
admodum erant.”—Ibid. cap. viii.</p></div>

in the Middle Ages,” pp. 107 sqq. We
may assume that John of Crema or the
pope must have conferred extraordinary powers on David before he could have
the presumption to thus arbitrarily
regulate and revolutionize the church.
This, indeed, may readily be conceived
as probable when we reflect how little
authority Rome could have exercised
over the Culdees, and how readily
Scotland must have been subjected to
the central power by placing her ecclesiastical
establishment in the hands of
the Sassenach monks.

Giraldus Cambrensis calls the Culdees
of Bardsey in Wales, “Cœlibes vel

“religiosissimi” (Itin. Cambr. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> 6—<i>ap.</i>

This forms part of a list of fifty-four
charges brought by Pelayo against the
clergy of his time—“peccant in his
communiter.” If the good bishop does
not exaggerate, these ministers of Christ
must have been a fearful curse to the
communities over which they presided
in the name of the Saviour.</p></div>

The introduction of the doctrine of
Innocent and Eugenius into the church
has given rise to some controversy. In
the Encyclical of Aug. 22, 1851, and
in the Syllabus of Dec. 1864, Pius IX.
has condemned the error of attributing
it to Boniface VIII. Some zealously
orthodox writers have endeavored to
prove that the church consistently
maintained this doctrine from the beginning,
but the contrary is admitted
by the greater number of Catholic authorities.

Peterboro (I. 33. M. R. Series). As a

It is possible that Frederick’s legislation
may have attracted attention
to the irregularities of the Neapolitan

two years later he deemed it necessary

“Tell our well-beloved son”—The

This admirable prelate, after enjoying
the episcopate for twenty-seven
years, was at length deposed in 1274 by
Gregory X., at the council of Lyons,
in consequence of his excesses “præsertem
de deflorationibus virginum,
stupris matronarum et incestibus monialium”
(Chron. Cornel. Zanfliet, ann.
1272). For some details of his excesses,
see the epistle addressed to him by
Gregory X. in Hardouin, Concil. T.
VII. p. 665. As Gregory had been
archdeacon of Liége, he was probably
familiar with the subject. Henry’s
promotion to the see of Liége was part
of the policy of Innocent IV. in elevating
William of Holland, his brother,
to the imperial throne as a competitor
to Frederic II. By special dispensation
Henry had enjoyed the see for ten years
before he was ordained to the priesthood,
and after his degradation he infested
the bishopric for twelve years,
until his death, one of his exploits being
the killing of his successor, John of
Enghien.—Hist. Monast. S. Laurent.

Ætat. <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span> c. 92, 93.—How utterly monastic
discipline was neglected in
Germany is shown by the fact that a
century earlier, in 1307, a council of
Cologne found it necessary to denounce
the frequency with which nuns were
seduced, left their convents, lived in
open and public profligacy, and then
returned unblushingly to their establishments,
where they seem to have
been received as a matter of course.—Concil.
Colon. ann. 1307 c. xvii.
(Hartzheim IV. 113). That this had
little effect is proved by a repetition
of the threats of punishment, three
years later (Concil. Colon. ann. 1310
c. ix.; Hartzheim IV. 122). In 1347,
John van Arckel, Bishop of Utrecht,
was obliged to prohibit men from having
access to the nunneries of his diocese,
in order to put an end to the
scandals which were apparently frequent
(Hartzheim IV. 350). In 1350,
the Emperor Charles IV. felt called
upon to address an earnest remonstrance
to the Archbishop of Mainz
concerning the unclerical habits of
his canons and clergy who spent the
revenues of the church in jousts and
tourneys, and who, in dress, arms,
and mode of life, were not to be distinguished
from laymen (Ibid. IV.
358). How little was effected by
these efforts is manifest when, in 1360,
William, Archbishop of Cologne, was
obliged to refute the assertions of those
monks and nuns who alleged in their
defence that custom allowed them to
leave their convents and contract marriage
(Ibid. IV. 493).</p></div>

however, will give a sufficient idea
of his experience. “Veritas ibi dementia

candida, togis amplissimis, adeoque

falsius videatur quam quod ait Maro
‘Frigidus in Venerem senior.’ Tam
calidi tamque præcipites in Venerem
senes sunt, tanta eos ætatis et status

inardescunt, sic in omne ruunt dedecus,
quasi omnis eorum gloria non in cruce
Christi sit, sed in commessationibus et
ebrietatibus, et quæ has sequuntur in

Hali Meidenhad. (Early English
Text Society, 1866.) The author at
times trenches closely on Manichæism.
It is true that he revives, with some
variation, the ancient computation of
the relative merits of the various conditions
of life—“For wedlock has its
fruit thirtyfold in heaven, widowhood
sixtyfold; maidenhood with a hundredfold
overpasses both” (p. 22);
but while he thus faintly disavows an
intention to revile marriage, he again
and again alludes to it as wicked and
impure <i>per se</i>. “Well were it for
them, were they on the day of their
bridal borne to be buried.... If thou
askest why God created such a thing
to be, I answer thee: God created it
never such; but Adam and Eve turned
it to be such by their sin, and marred
our nature” (p. 8).
</p>
<p>
Virginity he asserts to be the highest
attribute of humanity, and in heaven
virgins are the equals of angels and the
superiors of saints.—“Maidenhood is a
grace granted thee from heaven....
’Tis a virtue above all virtues, and to
Christ the most acceptable of all” (p. 10).
“To sing that sweet song
and that heavenly music which no
saints may sing, but maidens only in
heaven.... But the maiden’s song is
altogether unlike these, being common
to them with angels. Music beyond
all music in heaven. In their circle is
God himself; and his dear mother, the
precious maiden, is hidden in that
blessed company of gleaming maidens,
nor may any but they dance and sing”
(pp. 18-20).
</p>
<p>
As for matrimony and maternity,
nothing can redeem them in the eyes
of the ascetic.—“All other sins are
nothing but sins, but this is a sin and
besides denaturalizes thee and dishonoreth
thy body. It soileth thy soul
and maketh it guilty before God, and,
moreover, defileth thy flesh.... Now
what joy hath the mother? She hath
from the misshapen child sad care and
shame, both, and for the thriving one
fear, till she lose it for good, though it
would never have been in being for the
love of God, nor for the hope of heaven,
nor for the dread of hell” (p. 34).—But
I dare not follow him in his more
nauseous flights of imagination.
</p>
<p>
This is by no means a solitary example.
The same pious obscenity is
to be found, for instance, in some of
Abelard’s theological speculations addressed
to Heloise and her nuns, as in
his solution of her 42nd problem.</p></div>

The curiously artificial standard of
morals thus created may be estimated
from the case of the archdeacon of
Lisieux, who refused to accept an election
to the see of that place on account
of his inability to maintain the purity
requisite for the episcopal office. Vanquished
at length by the importunity of
his friends, he was consecrated, and
resolutely undertook to abandon his
evil habits. The unaccustomed privation
brought on a fearful disease, but
though assured that his life would prove
a sacrifice if he persisted in his resolution,
he resisted all entreaties, and refused
to purchase existence by sullying
his position. He thus fell a martyr to
a tenderness of conscience which had
not prevented him from indulgence
while filling the responsible position of
archdeacon.—Girald. Cambrens. Gemm.

This testimony concerning the Franciscans
is not confined to heretics and
laymen. Early in the fifteenth century,
a council of Magdeburg took
occasion to reprove them for the dissolute
and unclerical mode of life of
which they offered a conspicuous example.
It appears that they dignified with
the name of “Marthas” the female
companions who, in primitive ages,
were known as “agapetæ,” and who
had latterly acquired among the secular
clergy the title of “focariæ”—“et in
domibus suis frequenter soli cum mulieribus

verbis utamur) habitare non verentur.”—Concil.

There is a tradition that the Abbey
of Montariol lost its sovereignty over
the inhabitants of the village of that
name in consequence of a revolt caused
by the monks exacting this feudal right
in all its odious cynicism, in place of
receiving a payment in commutation as
was frequently done. A lively controversy
has arisen over the exactness of
this tradition, and the Abbé Marcellin,
in his edition of Le Bret’s <i>Histoire de
Montauban</i> seems to me to have successfully
proved its falsity. He admits,
however, that in his researches on the
subject he has found one case in which
an ecclesiastic undertook to enforce his
rights to the letter; and the President
Boyer, writing in the sixteenth century
(Decisiones, No. 17 Decis. 297) asserts
that he had seen the proceedings of a
lawsuit in which “Rector seu curatus
parochialis prætendebat ex consuetudine
primam habere sponsæ cognitionem”
(Eschbach, Introduction a l’Étude du
Droit, § 174). In some remote portions
of France the tribute was still exacted
“en nature” by temporal seigneurs as
late as the sixteenth century, as appears
from documents printed by MM. Mazure et Hatoulet (Fors de Béarn, p. 172).
Velly (Hist. de France, Paris, 1770, T.
III. p. 325) quotes from Laurière a document
of 1507 which, in recounting the
privileges of the barony of Saint-Martin
states that the Comte d’Eu has the
“droit de prélibation” there, and Boutaric
(Droits Seigneuriaux, Toulouse,
1775, p. 650) remarks that he has met
nobles who pretended to possess the
right, but that it had been abolished by
the courts. In 1854 M. Bouthors, in
his “Coutumes locales du bailliage
d’Amiens,” chanced to allude to a custom
by which the episcopal officers until
1607 exacted a tribute from newly married
couples for permission to pass together
the first three nights after the
wedding—a custom growing out of the
old <i>droit de marquette</i>. This aroused the
ire of the faithful, and M. Louis Veuillot
wrote a treatise in which he emphatically
denied that such a right had ever
existed, and a lively controversy arose
on the subject. M. Lagréze (Hist. du
Droit dans les Pyrénées, Paris, 1867,
p. 390) has examined the matter thoroughly
and the proof which he accumulates
of the existence of the right is
indisputable, though he denies that it
was ever claimed by ecclesiastics.</p></div>

The curious confusion of vice with
religion, fostered by mediæval sacerdotalism,
is well illustrated by the
complaint which Erasmus puts in the
mouth of the Virgin—“Et nonnumquam
ea petunt a virgine quæ verecundus
juvenis vix auderet petere a lena,
quæque ne pudet literis committere”
(Erasmi Colloq. Peregrinatio Religionis).

At a subsequent period we learn that

pro posse suo.” It was, moreover, enjoined
upon them not to enter a house
in which a woman lay in child-bed, not
to be present at the celebration of weddings

to receive any service from a woman,
even water for washing the hands.—See

how severe a sentence he was passing

marriage to be a pardonable offence.</p></div>

It is somewhat singular that Manichæism
should have been attributed
to a sect of heretics in Bosnia who styled
themselves Christians, and who were
brought back to the fold in 1203 by a
legate of Innocent III. It would appear
that, so far from entertaining Manichæan
doctrines, neglect of ecclesiastical
celibacy was actually one of their
erroneous practices, for in their pledge
of reformation they promise that separation
of man and wife shall thenceforth
be enforced “neque de cætero recipiemus
aliquem vel aliquam conjugatum, nisi
mutuo consensu, continentia promissa,
ambo pariter convertantur.”—Batthyani,

Thus, a council held at Cologne in
1306, in denouncing the mendicancy
of the Begghards, quotes Gen. III. 18:
“In sudore vultus tui vesceris pane
tuo,” and proceeds: “Quod ad fortes
et sui compotes moraliter intelligitur
esse dictum: et tales in ocio victum
vendicantes, eleemosynas rapiunt,
quæ infirmis et debilibus fuerant pauperibus
ministrandæ.” And in objecting
to their views of celibacy,
“Ajunt etiam: Nisi mulier virginitatem
in matrimonio deperditam doleat
et dolendo deploret, salvari non potest:
quasi matrimonium sit peccatum, cum
tamen ipsum ante peccatum in loco
sancto a sanctorum sanctissimo fuerit
institutum: quæ virginitas in fœtum
sobolis compensatur, per quam humana
natura stabilitate perdurat,” which contrasts
strangely with the teachings
quoted above from “Hali Meidenhad.”
Great stress, moreover, is laid upon the
indissolubility of the marriage vow and
the wickedness of separating husband
and wife:—“Quomodo spiritu Dei
agantur qui contra spiritum Dei
agunt, prohibentis virum ab uxore,
et e converso sine causa dimitti?”—Concil.
Coloniens. ann. 1306 cap. i.,
ii. (Hartzheim IV. 100-101). The
good fathers of the council were discreetly
blind to the antagonism of
their teachings to the received doctrines
and practices of the church.</p></div>

How persistent and profound was the
conviction which created the heresy is
shown by its prolonged existence.
Even as late as 1421 Martin V. found
it necessary to issue a Bull denouncing
it (Raynaldi Annal. ann. 1421 No. 4);
and in Germany the council of Wurzburg
in 1446, revived the old denunciations
against the Begghards and
Beguines (Hartzheim V. 336).</p></div>

A Wickliffite tract (“De Officio
Pastorali,” published by Prof. Lechler,
Leipzig, 1863) takes strong ground on
this point. Speaking of unchaste priests,
it says (P. I. cap. viii. pp. 16-17),
“Talis sic notorie sustentans curatum
dat imprudenter elemosinam contra
Christum ... periculosum peccatum
est crimini consentire; sed sic faciunt
qui taliter curato in temporalibus subministrant.”
And again (P. I. cap.
xvii.), “Subditi enim non debent audire
missam talium sacerdotum, et per
consequens non debent dare sibi oblaciones
vel decimas, ne videantur consencientes
crimini sic notorio in curatis.”</p></div>

In 1426, ten years after the execution
of Lord Cobham, a Franciscan
named Thomas Richmond was
brought before the council of York for
publicly preaching the high Wickliffite
doctrine “Sacerdos in peccato mortali
lapsus, non est sacerdos. Item quod
ecclesia nolente vel non puniente fornicarios,
licitum est sæcularibus eosdem
pœna carceris castigare, et ad hoc astringuntur
vinculo charitatis” (Wilkins
III. 488). This practical application
of the Hildebrandine principle
did not suit the church of the fifteenth
century. It was pronounced heretical,
and Friar Thomas was forced to recant.
</p>
<p>
Equally offensive to the memory of
Gregory was the decision of the Sorbonne
in 1486, condemning as heretical
the propositions of the puritan
Bishop of Meaux—“3. Un prêtre fornicateur
ne doit pas dire Dominus vobiscum
ni reciter l’office en aucun
lieu sacré. Ce qui est faux et suspect
d’heresie.”—“4. Les sacremens administrez
ou l’office dit par un tel prêtre
ne valent pas mieux que les cris des
chiens. Proposition fausse et erronée

scandaleuse et offensant les oreilles
pieuses dans la seconde.”—Fleury,

When, after the fearful disaster of
Taas, the council of Bâle, in 1432,
commenced the conferences which resulted
in the nominal reconciliation
of the Hussites, the fathers of the
council were much scandalized at
hearing the Bohemian deputies reverently
quote Wickliffe as the Evangelical
Doctor. In fact, Peter Payne, his
disciple, who did so much to promulgate
his doctrines in Bohemia, was one
of the disputants (Hartzheim V.
762-4). Even as early as 1403 the
errors of Wickliffe were formally condemned
by the University of Prague,
on presentation by the Ordinary of the
diocese, showing that they were already
spreading and attracting attention
(Höfler, Concil. Pragensia, p. 43.—Prag,
1862).</p></div>

Conciliab. Pragens. ann. 1420
can. xii., xiii.—At this time the Hussites
had full sway in Bohemia; the
council was held by Conrad, Archbishop
of Prague, who had adopted
their faith, and its canons were intended
for the internal regulation of
their own church (Hartzheim V. 198).
In the long conferences, extending
from 1431 to 1438, which resulted in
their reunion with the Catholic church,
there is no allusion to the subject of
celibacy. The four points on which
they insisted were, 1st, the communion
in both elements; 2d, the reformation
of morals by abrogating ecclesiastical
immunity; 3d, free preaching of the
Scripture; and 4th, the secularization
of church property (Ibid. 760-73).
How little, in fact, they differed in doctrinal
points from Rome is seen in the
confession of faith agreed upon at
Prague in 1432 (Johan, de Ragus. de
Reduct. Bohem. <i>ap.</i> Monument. Concil.
General. Sæc. xv. pp. 182 sq.).
</p>
<p>
This did not, however, save them
from the customary accusations of
immorality. Thus, a contemporary
describes the indulgence of indiscriminate
intercourse as one of the rules of
the sect (Joann. Fistenportii Chron.
ann. 1419.—Hahn. Collect. Monument.
T. I. p. 403), and, in 1431, Conrad,
Archbishop of Mainz, in convoking a
council to take action against them,
says of the sect “exterminavit clerum
et omnem cœlibatum commercio nephando
stupravit.”—Gudeni Cod.

Julius II. refused to listen to
those who desired a condemnation of
his memory. Leo X. honored him by
celebrating the Epiphany of 1515 in
his convent of San Marco. Julius III.
declared that he would deem heretical
any one who should attack him. Paul
IV. assembled a congregation for the
purpose of examining and deciding
upon his works, and after six months’
labor they reported that his writings
were unexceptionable, though a portion
which reflected too vigorously on the
papal court were declared to be unfitted
for general perusal.—Perrens, Jérome

This condition of affairs was not the
result of any abandonment of the
attempt to enforce the canons. Local
synods were meeting every year, and
scarcely one of them failed to call
attention to the subject, devising fresh
penalties to effect the impossible. The
result is shown in the lament of the
council of Cologne in 1423—“Quia
tamen, succrescente malitia temporis
moderni, labes hujusmodi criminis in
ecclesia Dei in tantum inolevit, quod
scandala plurima in populo sunt exorta,
et verisimiliter exoriri poterunt
in futurum, et ex fide dignorum relatione
percepimus quod quidam ecclesiarum
prælati et alii, etiam capitula
... tales in suis iniquitatibus sustinuerunt
et sustinent.” So far, however,
were the decrees of the council
from being effective, that the Archbishop
was obliged to modify them
and to declare that they should only
be enforced against those ecclesiastics
who were notoriously guilty, and who
kept their concubines publicly.—Concil.

Comp. Doeringii Chron. passim.
Döringk was minister or head of the
powerful Franciscan order in Saxony,
and therefore may be considered an
unexceptionable witness.
</p>
<p>
In the Polish diet of 1459, one of
its leading members brought forward
a series of propositions which showed
the feelings entertained by the people
towards papal exactions—“The Bishop
of Rome has invented a most unjust
motive for imposing taxes—the war
against the infidels.... The Pope
feigns that he employs his treasures
in the erection of churches; but in
fact he employs them to enrich his
relations,” etc.—Krasinski, Reformation
in Poland I. 96.
</p>
<p>
The councils of Constance and Bâle
had produced, for a time, a spirit of
great independence. John of Frankfort
does not hesitate to declare that the
papal authority is not binding when
in opposition to the law of God—“Unde
patet quod nec papalis vel et
imperialis constitutio legi Dei obvians
possit dici recta; nec aliquis
ipsorum potest licite mandare quod
sua constitutio servetur a subditis”
(Johann. de Francford. contra Feymeros).
According to the decisions of
the Decretalists, this was rank heresy,
and yet John of Frankfort was one of
the leading minds of the period, and
of unquestioned orthodoxy. He was a
popular preacher, a doctor of theology,
chaplain and secretary of the Count
Palatine of the Rhine, and a bold disputant
against the Hussites. He records
with his own hand that, as
inquisitor, he convicted and burned,
July 4th, 1429, at Lüders, an unfortunate
heretic who denied the propriety
of invoking the Virgin and the saints.
Under the skilful management, however,
of Nicholas V. and Pius II. this
spirit of independence died away, to
again revive, in the next century, in a
more determined form.</p></div>

Thus, in 1193, the general chapter
of the order promulgated the rule—“Si
contigerit mulieres abbatiam ordinis
nostri ex consensu intrare, ipse
abbas a patre abbate deponatur absque
retractatione. Et quicumque sine conscientia
abbatis introduxerit, de domo
ejiciatur, non reversurus, nisi per generale
capitulum.”—(Capit. General. Cisterc.
ann. 1193 cap. 6—apud Martene
Thesaur. IV. 1276.) The strictness with which this was enforced is illustrated
by the proceedings in 1205
against the abbot of the celebrated
house of Pontigny, because he had
allowed the Queen of France and her
train to be present at a sermon in the
chapel and a procession in the cloisters,
and to spend two nights in the infirmary.
He adduced in his defence
a special rescript of the pope and a
permission from the head of the order
in favor of the queen, but these were
pronounced insufficient, and sentence
was passed that he merited instant
deposition “quia tam enorme factum
sustinuit, in totius ordinis injuriam,”
but that in consequence of the powerful
intercession of the Archbishop of
Rheims and other bishops, he was
allowed to escape with lighter punishment.—(Hist.
Monast. Pontiniac.—Martene
Thesaur. III. 1245.)
</p>
<p>
This rule, indeed, was almost universal
in the ancient monasteries.
The great abbey of St. Martin of
Tours preserved it inviolate until the
incursions of the Northmen rendered
the house an asylum for the inhabitants
of the surrounding territory, and
the prohibition was subsequently revived
and formally approved by Leo
VII. in 938, (Leonis PP. VII. Epist.
vi.). In that of Sithieu, from the
time of its foundation early in the
seventh century, it was preserved
without infraction for more than three
centuries. Even the license of the
Carlovingian revolution did not cause
its inobservance; and when, amid the
disorders of the tenth century, the
Counts of Flanders became lay abbots
of the convent, and discipline was
almost forgotten, the mediation of two
bishops was required to obtain permission,
about the year 940, for Adela,
Countess of Flanders, prostrated with
mortal sickness, to be carried in and
laid before the altar, where she miraculously
recovered.—(De Mirac. S. Bertin.
Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> c. 12—Chron. S. Bertin.
c. 23, 24.)
</p>
<p>
So when Boniface founded the abbey
of Fulda, he prohibited the entrance of
women in any of the buildings, even
including the church. The rule was
preserved uninfringed through all the
license of the tenth and eleventh centuries,
and when, in 1132, the Emperor
Lothair came to Fulda to celebrate
Pentecost, his empress was not allowed
to witness the ceremonies. So when
Frederic Barbarossa, in 1135, spent his
Easter there, he was not permitted to
enter the town, because his wife was
with him. In 1398 Boniface IX., at
the request of the Abbot John Merlaw,
relaxed the rule and permitted women
to attend at the services of the church—shortly
after which it was destroyed
by lightning, as a warning for the future.—(Paullini
Chron. Badeslebiens.
$ viii.)—An equally convincing indication
of the favor with which this regulation
was regarded by Heaven was
afforded when Abbot Helisacar, about
the year 830, introduced it in the celebrated
monastery of St. Riquier, and
immediately the number of miracles
worked by the relics of the Saint increased
in a notable degree (Chron.
Centulensis Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> cap. iv).—At
the Grande Chartreuse, founded by St.
Bruno towards the end of the eleventh
century, women were not even allowed
to enter on the lands of the community.—Chart.

When Diether was elected Archbishop
of Mainz, in 1459, his envoys
sent to obtain his confirmation from
Pius II. were stupefied with a demand
for 20,506 florins—more than double the
amount of annates previously assessed
on the see. He refused to yield to the
demand, but by a little sharp practice
between the Apostolic Chamber and
the Roman bankers he became entangled,
and on his persistent refusal
he was prosecuted for the amount, deposed
by the pope, and Adolph of Nassau
appointed in his place, leading to a
bloody war and the devastation of city
and territory.—Appell. Dom. Dytheri
(Senckenberg. Selecta Juris T. IV. p.
393).—Cf. Helwich de Dissidio Moguntino
(Rer. Moguntiac. Script. T. II.).
This is probably the fraud alluded to
by the Diet of 1510, where it was complained
that the annates of the see of
Mainz were raised from 10,000 florins
to 25,000; and this latter sum was exacted
seven times in one generation,
resulting in taxation on the peasantry
so severe that an insurrection against
the clergy was threatened.—Remed.
contra Gravam. (Freher. et Struv. II.
678).
</p>
<p>
In the complaint made to Adrian
VI., in 1523, by the Diet of Nürnberg,
it is asserted that three generals of the
mendicant orders at Rome had purchased
the cardinalate with gold wrung
from Germany.—Gravam. Nationis
German, cap. lxxiii.—<i>ap.</i> Le Plat,
Monument. Concil. Trident. II. 203.
</p>
<p>
The general popular opinion of the
Roman court is manifested in the Epistolæ
Obscurorum Virorum, when speaking
of the quarrel between Reuchlin
and the theologians, which had been
carried before the papal tribunal—“Si
Papa est pro theologi, tunc non timeo;
etiam audivi ab uno notabili viro, qui
est officialis curiæ, qui dixit. Quid
nobis hic cum literis? Si Reuchlin
habet pecuniam, mittat huc: quia in
curia oportet habere pecunias, alias
nihil potest expedire.”
</p>
<p>
That this estimate of the papal curia
was shared by the orthodox is shown
in the story told of Pierre Danes,
Bishop of Vaur, who in 1545 was sent
as ambassador by Francis I. to the
Council of Trent. In debate a French
theologian was inveighing against the
corruptions of the Rota, when an Italian
ecclesiastic sneeringly cried out, “Gallus
cantat.” Danes promptly rejoined,
“Utinam illo gallicinio Petrus ad resipiscentiam
et fletum excitetur.”—Le
Plat, Monument. Concil. Trident. VII.
224.</p></div>

The Epist. Obseur. Viror. probably
reflects the general sentiment of the
conservatives of the time in denouncing
Erasmus and the learned wits as
heretics. “Quia juvenes volunt se
æquiparare senibus, et discipuli magistris,
et juristæ theologis, et est magna
confusio, et surgunt multi hæretici et
pseudochristiani, Iohann. Reuchlin,
Erasmus Roterodamus: Bilibaldus
nescio quis, et Ulricus Huttenus, Hermannus
Buschius, Jacobus Wimphelingus,
qui scripsit contra Augustinenses,
et Sebastianus Brandt, qui
scripsit contra prædicatores, etc.”
</p>
<p>
So, at a later date, after Luther had
arisen, the “Conciliabulum Theologistarum”
classes them together “Habeo
etiam ego unum spiritum familiarem;
illum ego volo mittere ad Lutherum et
Erasmum de nocte in lectum, ut eos
tribulet et vexet.”</p></div>

Speaking of the Virgin’s milk and
the countless relics of the cross everywhere
exposed to the adoration of the

The popular view of the priesthood
is well summed up by Erasmus in the
following dialogue: “<span class="smcap">Cocles</span>, Cur
mavis sacerdotium quam uxorem?—<span class="smcap">Pamphagus</span>,
Quia mihi placet otium.
Arridet Epicurea vita.—Co. At mea

Sed tristis est solitudo, adeo ut

Paradiso nisi deus illi adjunxisset
Evam.—<span class="smcap">Pam.</span> Non deerit Eva cui sit
opulentum sacerdotium,” etc.—Erasmi
Colloq. de Captandis Sacerdotiis.
</p>
<p>
It is, however, perhaps, in the “Encomium
Moriæ” that he gives fullest
rein to his bitter satire. His own sad
experience of conventual life gave
him special opportunity of declaiming
against the monks “qui se vulgo religiosos
ac monachos appellant, utroque
falsissimo cognomine, quum et bona
pars istorum longissime absit a religione,
et nulli magis omnibus locis sint
obvii.” Their habit, their observances,
their discipline, their ignorance, idleness,
vices, are recounted at great
length and with the most stinging
ridicule, and he makes Folly dismiss
them with the contemptuous valediction,
“Verum ego istos histriones, tam
ingratos beneficiorum meorum dissimulatores
quam improbos simulatores pietatis
libenter relinquo.” The secular
priesthood, the bishops, and even the
pope himself, are treated with little
more respect, and every class of the
ecclesiastical body is stigmatized as
endeavoring to thrust upon others the
care of the flock and industrious only
in shearing the sheep.
</p>
<p>
The “Encomium Moriæ” had an
immediate and immense success.
Numberless editions were required to
supply the avidity of the learned,
and it was immediately translated
into almost every language of Europe
for the benefit of the unlearned. It
appeared in 1509; the Colloquies in
1516.—When these works had produced
their result, their dangerous
tendencies were discovered, and they
enjoyed the honor of being included
in the first Index Expurgatorius (App.
Concil. Trident). Cardinal Caraffa,
indeed, in 1538, had urged upon Paul
III. the propriety of excluding the
Colloquies from use in schools as a
text-book for students.—Concil. de
Emend. Eccles. (Le Plat, Monument.
Concil. Trident. II. 602).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1041_1041" href="#FNanchor_1041_1041" class="label">1041</a>
The “Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum”
was certainly published before
1516, probably in 1515 (Ebert, Bibliog. Dict. s. v.).—It is equally severe
upon the monks—“Tunc ille dixit:
ego distinguo de monachis, quia accipiuntur
tribus modis. Primo, pro
sanctis et utilibus, sed illi sunt in
cœlo. Secundo, pro nec utilibus nec
inutilibus, et illi sunt picti in ecclesia.
Tertio modo pro illis qui adhuc
vivunt, et illi multis nocent, etiam
non sunt sancti, quia ita superbi sunt
sicut unus sæcularium. Et ita libenter
habent pecunias et pulchras mulieres,”
etc. And again, “Ubi enim
diabolus pervenire vel aliquid officere
non potest, ibi semper mittit unam
malam antiquam vetulam vel unum
monachum.”</p></div>

Even in this, Luther was by no
means the first. Erasmus had exposed
the wickedness of the system with fully
as much fervor in the “Encomium
Moriæ.”—“Hic mihi puta negotiator
aliquis, aut miles, aut judex, abjecto ex
tot rapinis unico nummulo, universam
vitæ Lernam semel expurgatam putat,
totque perjuria, tot libidines, tot ebrietates,
tot rixas, tot cædes, tot imposturas,
tot perfidias, tot proditiones
existimat velut ex pacto redimi, et ita
redimi ut jam liceat ad novum scelerum
orbem de integro reverti.”—And in the
“Epistolæ Obscurorum Vivorum” the
falseness of its promises was unflinchingly
asserted.</p></div>

Pomeranius, a priest of Wittenberg,
in writing to Spalatin, gives as the
reason of Luther’s marriage—“Maligna
fama effecit ut Doct. Martinus insperato
fieret conjunx;” and Luther, in a letter
to the same, admits this even more distinctly—“Os
obstruxi infamantibus me
cum Catherina Borana.” That his
action was not generally approved by
his friends is apparent from his asking
Michael Stiefel to pray that his new
life may sanctify him—“Nam vehementer
irritantur sapientes, etiam inter
nostros.”—Spalatin. ubi sup.
</p>
<p>
That surprise should have been
aroused is singular, when he had already
proclaimed the most extreme views in
favor of matrimony. As early as 1522
he delivered his famous “Sermo de
Matrimonio,” in which he enjoins it in
the strictest manner as a duty incumbent
upon all. Thus, in considering the impediments
to marriage, he treats of
vows, concerning which he says: “Sin
votum admissum est, videndum tibi
est, ut supra memoravi, num tribus
eviratorum generibus comprehendaris,
quæ conjugio ademit Deus, ubi te in
aliquo istorum uno non repereris, votum
rescindas, monasticen deseras oportet;
moxque ad naturalem sociam adjungas
te matrimonii lege.”—P. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> c. 8 (Opp.
Ed. Vuitemberg. V. 121). To this
must be added his decided opinions on
the subject of conjugal rights, as developed
in the well-known passage which
has excited so much animadversion, and
which, if we are to interpret it literally,
conveys a doctrine which sounds so
strangely as the precept of a teacher of
morality. In treating of the causes of
divorce, he remarks: “Tertia ratio est,
ubi alter alteri sese subduxerit, ut debitam
benevolentiam persolvere nolit, aut
habitare cum renuerit. Reperiuntur
enim interdum adeo pertinaces uxores,
qui etiam si decies in libidinem prolabentur
mariti pro sua duritia non
curarent. Hic oportunum est ut maritus
dicat ‘Si tu nolueris, alia volet.’
Si domina nolit, adveniat ancilla, ita
tamen ut antea iterum et tertio uxorem
admoneat maritus, et coram aliis ejus
etiam pertinaciam detegat, ut publice
et ante conspectum ecclesiæ, duritia
ejus et agnoscatur et reprehendatur.
Si tum renuat, repudia eam, et in vicem
Vasti, Ester surroga, Assueri regis exemplo”
(Ibid. p. 123).
</p>
<p>
One conclusion, at least, can safely
be drawn from this, that the morality
of the age had impressed Luther with
the belief that the self-restraint of
chastity was impossible.
</p>
<p>
That the Catholics should make themselves
merry over the marriage of the
apostate monk and nun was to be expected,
and Jerome Emser did not
think it beneath him to write an epithalamium
on the wedding of his
former friend, of which the following
may be taken as a specimen—

Reformat. Cleri German. (Hartzheim
VI. 198).—“Hanc perditissimam

</p>
<p>
There was no scruple in confessing
this fact by those who spoke authoritatively
for the Catholic church, and it
long continued to be alleged as the
cause of the stubbornness of the heretics.
Thus the Bishop of Constance,
in the canons of his Synod of 1567—“Estote
etiam memores, damnatam et
detestandam cleri vitam huic malo in
quo, proh dolor! versamur, majori ex
parte ansam præbuisse.... Omnes
sapientes peritique viri unanimi sententia
hoc asserunt, hocque efflagitant
penitus, ut prius clerus ecclesiarumque
ministri ac doctores a vitæ sordibus
repurgentur, quam ulla cum adversariis
nostris de doctrina concordia expectari
queat.” And then, after describing in
the strongest terms the vices of the
clergy and their unwillingness to reform,
he adds “Quæ sane morum turpitudo,
vehementer et tantopere imperiti populi
animos offendit ut subinde magis
magisque a catholica nostra religione
alienior efficiatur, atque sacerdotium
una cum sacerdotibus doctrinam juxta
atque doctores, execretur, dirisque
devoveat: ita ut protinus ad quamvis
sectam deficere potius paratus sit quam
quod ad ecclesiam redire velit.”—Synod.
Constant. ann. 1567 (Hartzheim VII.
455).
</p>
<p>
Pius V. himself did not hesitate to
adopt the same view. In an epistle
addressed to the abbots and priors of
the diocese of Freysingen, in 1567, he
says—“Cum nobiscum ipsi cogitamus
quæ res materiam præbuerit tot tantisque
pestiferis hæresibus ... tanti
mali causam præcipue fuisse judicamus
corruptos prælatorum mores, qui ...
eandemque vivendi licentiam iis, quibus
præerant permittentes et exemplo eos
suo corrumpentes, maximum apud laicos
odium contemptionem et invidiam non
immerito contraxerunt.” (Hartzheim.
VII. 586).
</p>
<p>
Alfonso de Castro in 1556 declares
that the priesthood was one of the efficient
causes of the spread of heresy.
It would be difficult for orthodoxy to
maintain itself without the direct interposition
of God, in view of the scandalous
lives, and general worthlessness
of all orders of ecclesiastics, whose excessive
numbers, ignorance, and turpitude
exposed them to contempt.—Alph. de

Reformat. Cleri German, cap. xv.—So
when, in 1521, Conrad, Bishop of
Wurzburg, issued a mandate for the
reformation of his clergy, he described
them as for the most part abandoned to
gluttony, drunkenness, gambling, quarrelling,
and lust.—Mandat. pro. Reformat.
Cleri. (Gropp, Script. Rer.

Bishop of Bamberg, in complaining of
his clergy, shows us how little respect
was habitually paid to the incessant
repetition of the canons.—“Condolenter
referimus vitam et honestatem
clericalem adeo apud quamplures nostrarum
civitatis et dioceseos clericos
esse obumbratam ut vix inter clericos
et laycos discrimen habeatur: et ipsa

When such complaints were made by

Dominicans and Franciscans of the

Erasmi Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXXI.</span> Epist. 43.
</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding the sarcasm, popularly
attributed to Erasmus, on the occasion
of Luther’s union with Catharine
von Bora—that the Reformation had
turned out to be a comedy, seeing that
it resulted in a marriage—he continued
to raise his voice in favor of abolishing
the rule of celibacy. Thus he writes,
in October, 1525, “Vehementer laudo
cœlibatum, sed ut nunc habet sacerdotum
ac monachorum vita, præsertim
apud Germanos, præstaret indulgeri
remedium matrimonii” (Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">XVIII.</span>
Epist. 9). And again, in 1526, “Ego
nec sacerdotibus permitto conjugium,
nec monachis relaxo vota, ni id fiat ex
auctoritate Pontificum, ad ædificationem
ecclesiæ non ad destructionem.... In
primis optandum esset sacerdotes et
monachos castitatem ac cœlestem vitam
amplecti. Nunc rebus adeo contaminatis,
fortasse levius malum erat eligendum”
(Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">XVIII.</span> Epist. 4).
</p>
<p>
Yet, in his “Liber de Amabili
Ecclesiæ Concordia,” written in 1533
in the hope of reuniting the severed
church, while awaiting the promised
general council which was to reconcile
all things, Erasmus did not hesitate to
give utterance to the opinion that those
who fell away in heresy or even schism
were worse than those who lived impurely
in the true faith.</p></div>

is amusingly shown in a

Vienna, to Ferdinand, in 1540, concerning
some proposed negotiations
then on foot for a reconciliation between
the churches. He lays down as a condition
precedent to reunion that all the

In a sermon before the Convocation
of 1512, Colet is very severe upon the
vices of the church—“we are troubled
in these days by heretics—men mad
with strange folly—but this heresy of
theirs is not so pestilential and pernicious
to us and the people as the vicious
and depraved lives of the clergy”—and
he urges the prelates to revive the
ancient canons, the enforcement of
which would purify the church. (Seebohm’s
Oxford Reformers of 1498, p.
170. London, 1867.)
</p>
<p>
The title of this work seems to me a
misnomer. Neither Colet nor Erasmus
had the aggressive spirit of martyrdom
which was essential to the character of
a reformer in those fierce times. They
could deplore existing evils, but lacked
all practical boldness in applying remedies,
and their influence is only to be
traced in the minds which they unwittingly
trained to do work which they
themselves abhorred.</p></div>

Responsio ad Lutherum, <i>passim</i>:
“Pater, frater, potator Lutherus,”
seems to be a favorite expression, but is
mild in comparison with others—“novum
inferorum Deum,” “Satanista
Lutherus,” “pediculoso fraterculo.”
Luther’s friends are “nebulonum, potatorum,
scortatorum, sicariorum, senatum,”
and More winds up his theological
argument with—“furiosum fraterculum
et latrinarium nebulonem cum
suis furiis et furoribus, cum suis merdis
et stercoribus cacantem cacatumque
relinquere.”
</p>
<p>
Luther was himself a master in
theological abuse, but More’s admiring
biographer, Stapleton, boasts that the
German was appalled at the superior
vigor of the Englishman, and for the
first time in his life he declined further
controversy—“magis mutus factus est
quam piscis.” (Stapletoni Vit. T.
Mori cap. iv.) As More, however,
published the tract under the name of
“William Rosse, an Englishman who
had recently died in Rome, Luther’s
reticence is more easily to be accounted
for”.</p></div>

“Nempe virtutem definiunt, secundum

tanquam operationum omnium finem,
ipsa nobis natura præscribit: ex cujus
præscripto vivere, virtutem definiunt”
(Utopiæ Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> Tit. de Peregrinatione).
In another passage, however, he describes
two sects or heresies, the one
consisting of men who abstained from
marriage and the use of flesh, the other
of those who devoted themselves to
labor, marrying as a duty and indulging
in food to increase their strength, and
says of them “Hos Utopiani prudentiores,
at illos sanctiores reputant” (Ibid.

As published in the Harleian Miscellany,
the Beggars’ Petition bears the
date of 1538, but internal evidence
would assign it to a time anterior to
the suppression of the monasteries, and
Burnet attributes it to the period under
consideration, saying that it was written
by Simon Fish, of Gray’s Inn, that it
took mightily with the public, and that
when it was handed to the king by
Ann Boleyn, “he lik’d it well, and
would not suffer anything to be done
to the author” (Hist. Reform. I. 160).
Froude, indeed, assigns it to the date of
1528, and states that Wolsey issued a
proclamation against it, and further,
that Simon Fish, the author, died in
1528 (Hist. Engl. Ch. <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>), while
Strype (Eccles. Memorials1. 165) includes
it in a list of books prohibited
by Cuthbert, Bishop of London, in
1526. In the edition of 1546, the date
of 1524 is attributed to it.
</p>
<p>
The tone of that which was thus
equally agreeable to the court and to
the city, may be judged from the following
extracts, which are by no means
the plainest spoken that might be
selected.
</p>
<p>
“§ 13. Yea, and what do they more?
Truly, nothing but apply themselves
by all the sleights they may to have to
do with every man’s wife, every man’s
daughter, and every man’s maid; that
cuckoldry should reign over all among
your subjects; that no man should
know his own child; that their bastards
might inherit the possessions of
every man, to put the right-begotten
children clean beside their inheritance,
in subversion of all estates and godly
order.
</p>
<p>
“§ 16. Who is she that will set her
hands to work to get three-pence a day,
and may have at least twenty-pence a
day to sleep an hour with a friar, a
monk, or a priest? Who is he that
would labour for a groat a day, and
may have at least twelve-pence a day
to be a bawd to a priest, a monk, or a
friar?
</p>
<p>
“§ 31. Wherefore, if your grace will
set their sturdy loobies abroad in the
world, to get them wives of their own,
to get their living with their labour, in
the sweat of their faces, according to
the commandment of God, <i>Gen.</i> iii., to
give other idle people, by their example,
occasion to go to labour; tye these holy,
idle thieves to the carts to be whipped
naked about every market-town, till
they will fall to labour, that they may,
by their importunate begging, not take
away the alms that the good Christian
people would give unto us sore, impotent,
miserable people your bedemen.”</p></div>

Burnet I. 193-4, 222-4;—Parl.
Hist. I. 526-7. To our modern notions,
there is something inexpressibly disgusting
in the openness with which
bribes were tendered to Cromwell by
those who were eager to obtain grants
of abbey lands (Suppression of Monasteries,
<i>passim</i>). On the other hand,
the abbots and abbesses who feared for
their houses had as little scruple in
offering him large sums for his protection.
Thus the good Bishop Latimer
renders himself the intermediary (Dec.
16th, 1536) of an offer from the Prior
of Great Malvern of 500 marks to the
king and 200 to Cromwell to preserve
that foundation; while the Abbot, of
Peterboro’ tendered the enormous sum
of 2500 marks to the king and £300 to
Cromwell (Ibid. 150, 179). The liberal
disposition of the latter seems to have
made an impression, for, though he
could not save his abbey, he was appointed
the first Bishop of Peterboro’—a
see erected upon the ruins of the
house.</p></div>

“capacities” empowered them to perform
the functions of secular priests.

paying the usual fee.</p></div>

A letter from John Bartelot to
Cromwell shows that the abbot purchased
secrecy by distributing thirty
pounds to those who detected him, and
promising them thirty more. This
latter sum was subsequently reduced to
six pounds, for which the holy man
gave his note. This not being paid at
maturity, he was sued, when he had
the audacity to complain to Cromwell,
and to threaten to prosecute the intruders
for robbery and force them to
return the money paid. Bartelot relates
his share in the somewhat questionable
transaction with great naïveté, and
applies to Cromwell for protection.—Suppression

This may have been true, for Dr.
London was one of the miserable tools
who are the fitting representatives of
the time. His desire to discover the
irregularities of the monastic orders arose
from no reverence for virtue, for he
underwent public penance at Oxford
for adultery with a mother and daughter
(Strype, Eccles. Memor. I. 376); and
his zeal in suppressing the monasteries
was complemented with equal zeal in persecuting Protestants. In 1543 he
made himself conspicuous, in conjunction
with Gardiner, by having heretics
burned under the provisions of the Six
Articles. His eagerness in this good
work led him to commit perjury, on
conviction of which he was pilloried in
Windsor, Reading, and Newbury, and
thrust into the Fleet, where he died.—Strype,
Memorials of Cranmer, Book
<span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> Chap. 26, 27.

In fact, Henry’s capricious despotism
rendered it almost impossible that he
could be served by men of self-respect
and honor.</p></div>

During his visitation (Aug. 27th, 1538),
the Bishop of Dover writes to Cromwell,
“I have Malkow’s ere that Peter
stroke of, as yt ys wrytyn, and a M. as
trewe as that” (Suppression of Monasteries,
p. 212). In a report of Dec.
28th, 1538, Dr. London observes, with
dry humor, “I have dyvers other propre

Ursula, wich bycause ther ys no maner
of sylver abowt them, I reserve tyll I
have another hedd of herse, wich I
schall fynd in my waye within theese

(Ibid. p. 234). Dr. Leighton
writes in the same spirit to Cromwell—“Yee

wherein ye shall see Stranger Things as
shall appear by the Scripture. As God’s
Coat, or Ladie’s Smock; Part of God’s
Supper, In cœna Domini; Pars petræ

Daughter married yet of the goods of

he never meddled with married women;
but all with Maidens, the fairest could
be gotten. And always married them
right well. The Pope, considering his
fragility, gave him license to keep a

(Strype, Eccles. Memor. I. 253).—Nicander
Nucius (op. cit. pp. 51-62)

the time of the miracles engineered by
the monks to stave off their impending
doom.</p></div>

Thus “An Exposition into the
sevenith Chapitre of the firste Epistle
to the Corinthians” seems to have been
almost entirely devoted to an argument
against celibacy, adducing all manner
of reasons derived from nature, morality,
necessity, and Scripture, and describing
forcibly the evils arising from the rule.
The author does not hesitate to declare
that “Matrimony is as golde, the spirituall
estates as dung,” and the tenor of
his writings may be understood from
his triumphant exclamation, after insisting
that all the Apostles and their
immediate successors were married—“Seeing
that ye chose not married men
to bishoppes, other Criste must be a foole or unrighteous which so did chose,
or you anticristis and deceyvers.”

Wilkins III. 778.—Strype, in his
“Memorials of Cranmer,” Bk. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> Chap.
18, gives this proclamation as dated
Nov. 16, in the 30th year of Henry
VIII. which would place it in 1538,
and Bishop Wilkins also prints (III.
696) from Harmer’s “Specimen of
Errors” the same with unimportant
variations, as “given this 16th day of
November, in the 13th year of our
reign,” which would place it in 1521.
It is impossible, however, at a time when
even the Lutherans of Saxony had
scarcely ventured on the innovation, that in England priestly marriage could
already have become as common as the
proclamation shows it to be. The bull
of Leo X., thanking Henry for his refutation
of Luther, was dated Nov. 4th,
1521, and we may be sure that the
king’s zeal for the faith would at such
a moment have prompted him to much
more stringent measures of repression,
if he had ventured, at that epoch, to
invade the sacred precincts of ecclesiastical
jurisdiction—a thing he would
have been by no means likely to do.
The date of 1521 is therefore evidently
an error.
</p>
<p>
For the same reasons I have been
forced to reject a discussion in convocation
of the same year (Wilkins III.
697), in which the question of sacerdotal
marriage was decided triumphantly
in the affirmative. The proceedings
are evidently those of Dec. 1547, in the
first year of Edward VI.</p></div>

MS. State Paper Office (Froude,

is sufficiently suggestive as to the
interior life of the monastic orders to
deserve transcription. “As we were
of late at Walden, the abbot there
being a man of good learning and right
sincere judgment, as I examined him
alone, showed me secretly, upon stipulation
of silence, but only unto you as
our judge, that he had contracted
matrimony with a certain woman secretly,
having present thereat but one
trusty witness; because he, not being
able, as he said, to contain, though he
could not be suffered by the laws of
man, saw he might do it lawfully by
the laws of God; and for the avoiding
of more inconvenience, which before
he was provoked unto, he did thus,
having confidence in you that this act
should not be anything prejudicial unto
him.”</p></div>

however, that the clergy were worse
than the laity. During the visitation
of the monasteries, Thomas Leigh, one
of the visitors, says, in writing to Cromwell,
Aug. 22, 1536, concerning the region
between Coventry and Chester
“For certain of the knights and gentlemen,
and most commonly all, liveth
so incontinently, having their concubines
openly in their houses, with five
or six of their children, and putting
from them their wives, that all the
country therewith be not a little offended,
and taketh evil example of
them” (Miscellaneous State Papers,
London, 1778, I. 21). It perhaps
would not be easy to determine the
exact responsibility of the clergy for
this immorality of their flocks.</p></div>

c. xiv. Mr. Froude endeavors to relieve
Henry of the responsibility of this
measure, and quotes Melanchthon to
show that its cruelty is attributable to
Gardiner (Hist. Engl. III. 395). He
admits, however, that the bill as passed
differs but slightly from that presented
by the king himself, with whom the
committee which framed it must have
acted in concert. According to Strype,
“The Parliament men said little against
this bill, but seemed all unanimous for
it; neither did the Lord Chancellor
Audley, no, nor the Lord Privy Seal,
Cromwel, speak against it: the reason
being, no question, because they saw
the king so resolved upon it.... Nay,
at the very same time it passed, he
(Cranmer) stayed and protested against
it, though the king desired him to go
out, since he could not consent to it.
Worcester (Latimer) also, as well as
Sarum (Shaxton), was committed to
prison; and he, as well as the other,
resigned up his bishopric upon the act”—(Memorials
of Cranmer, Book <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>
Chap. 19). This shows us how the
royal influence was used. Cranmer,
indeed, in his reply to the Devonshire
rebels, when in 1549 they demanded
the restoration of the Six Articles, expressly
asserts “that if the king’s
majesty himself had not come personally
into the Parliament house, those
lawes had never passed” (Ibid. App.

There is a story current that soon
after the passage of the Act, the Duke
of Norfolk, who had had so much to do
with it, on meeting a former chaplain
of his named Lawney, jocularly said to
him “O, my Lawney (knowing him of
old much to favor priests’ matrimony),
whether may priests now have wives or
no?” “If it please your grace,” replied
he, “I cannot well tell whether priests
may have wives or no; but well I wot,

wives will have priests.”—Strvpe’s

His first marriage was entered into
while he was still quite young, and before
he had taken orders. The second,
however, shows that he acted with some
independence, for it took place in 1531,
before Henry’s open rupture with
Rome, and while he was ambassador to
the Emperor. At that time he was
King’s chaplain and archdeacon of
Taunton, and his nuptials therefore
were plainly an indication of heresy.—Strype’s

Sanders, in commenting upon Cranmer’s

Richard Hilles, writing in 1541 to
Henry Bullinger, assumes that this modification
of the Six Articles only applied
to those who were guilty of incontinence,
and that it did not “appear to the
king at all extreme still to hang those
clergymen who marry or who retain
those wives whom they had married previous
to the former statute” (Original
Letters, Parker Soc. Pub. p. 205)—but
both Burnet and the Parliamentary
History make no such distinction, and
in the abstract of the bill as printed in
the Statutes at Large (I. 281) it is described
as applicable to “priests married
or unmarried.”</p></div>

A specimen of the form of restitution
subscribed by those who were restored
on profession of amendment
and repentance has been preserved—“Whereas ...
I the said Robert do
now lament and bewail my life past,
and the offence by me committed; intending
firmly by God’s grace hereafter
to lead a pure, chast, and continent
life ... and do here before my
competent judge and ordinary most
humbly require absolution of and from
all such censures and pains of the laws
as by my said offence and ungodly behavior
I have incurred and deserved:
promising firmly ... never to return
to the said Agnes Staunton as to my
wife or concubine, &amp;c.”—(Wilkins

In 1561 the remains were exhumed
from the stables of Dr. Marshall, the
previous dean of Christ’s Church, and
reburied in the church, the precaution
being taken of mingling them with the
bones of St. Frideswide, so as to prevent
any future profanation in case of
another revolution of religion. The
affair excited considerable attention at
the time, and produced the following
epigram:

Parker’s Correspondence, p. 66.—Sanders
does not fail to make the most
of this refusal to legalize priestly marriage
by act of Parliament, and of the
hesitation which rendered the final
decision a mere toleration and not an
approval. “Clerus enim in Anglia

est valde spiritualis, primo quoque
tempore de nuptiis cogitabat; multumque
sategit, ut conjugia Episcoporum

by the word of God, nor any
example of the primitive church, but
that the priests and ministers of the
church may lawfully, for the avoiding
of fornication, have an honest and
sober wife, and that for the same purpose
the same was by act of Parliament
in the time of our dear brother King
Edward the Sixth made lawful, whereupon
a great number of the clergy of
this realm were married and so continue;
yet, because there hath grown offence
and some slander to the church, by
lack of discreet and sober behavior in
many ministers of the church, both in
chusing of their wives and undiscreet
living with them, the remedy whereof
is necessary to be sought; it is thought
therefore very necessary that no manner
of priest or deacon shall hereafter
take to his wife any manner of woman
without the advice and allowance first
had upon good examination by the
bishop of the same diocese and two
justices of the peace of the same shire
dwelling next to the place where the
same woman hath made her most abode
before her marriage; nor without the
goodwill of the parents of the said
woman if she have any living, or two
of the next of her kinsfolks, or for lack
of the knowledge of such, of her master
or mistress where she serveth. And
before she shall be contracted in any
place, he shall make a good and certain
proof thereof to the minister or to the
congregation assembled for that purpose,
which shall be upon some holy-day
where divers may be present. And
if any shall do otherwise, that then
they shall not be permitted to minister
either the word or the sacraments of
the church, nor shall be capable of any
ecclesiastical benefice. And for the
marriages of any bishops, the same
shall be allowed and approved by the
metropolitan of the province and also
by such commissioners as the Queen’s
Majesty thereunto shall appoint. And
if any master or dean or any head of
any college shall purpose to marry, the
same shall not be allowed but by such
to whom the visitation of the same
doth properly belong, who shall in any
wise provide that the same turn not to
the hindrance of their house”—(Wilkins

Wilkins IV. 189-91.—This commission
was the commencement of the
Court of High Commission, which
played so lamentable a part in the
troubles of the succeeding reigns. The
result of its visitation in 1559 shows
how little real conviction existed among
the clergy who had been exposed to the
capricious persecutions of alternating
rulers. Out of 9400 beneficiaries in
England under Mary, but 14 bishops,
6 abbots, 12 deans, 12 archdeacons, 15
heads of colleges, 50 prebendaries, and
80 rectors of parishes had abandoned
their preferment on account of Protestantism
(Burnet Vol. II. Append.
217), and of these it is fair to assume
that the higher dignitaries at least had
not been allowed to retain their positions.</p></div>

Qui autem istis darent filias suas,
ne protestantes quidem fere inveniebantur,
nedum Catholici: primum quia
existimant id esse per se infame, ut sint
vel dicantur uxores presbyterorum.
Secundo, quia juxta leges regni non
sunt adhuc vera sed adulterina conjugia,
ac proinde proles illegitima.
Tertio quia non accrescit his uxoribus
aut liberis suis ex maritorum loco aut
honore in Republica ulla dignitas aut
existimatio, quod est contra naturam
veri matrimonii. Non enim Archiepiscopus,
Episcopus, aliusve hodie prælatus
in Anglia si sit conjugatus, tribuit
quicquam ex eo honoris vel præeminentia
uxori suæ, non magis quam si
esset ejus tantum concubina. Hinc sit
ut nec eas Elizabetha in aulam, nec
principum uxores in consortium ullo
modo admittant, ne Archiepiscoporum
quidem vocatas conjuges; sed debent
eas mariti domi continere, pro vasis
tantem libidinis aut necessitatis suæ.
Quæ istis ergo conditionibus, vel summis
prælatis conjungerentur, cum honestiores
paucæ aut nullæ reperiebantur,
quas poterant habere accipere fuit
necesse. Sed et aliis modis utcumque
istorum hominum cupiditati per magistratum

Nam et Collegiorum alumni qui in
Anglicanis universitatibus admodum
multi erant, otioque ac saturitate panis
abundabant, ac admodum provecti
ætate erant, cupiebant et ipsi habere
uxores; sed videbatur inconveniens, et
id privilegii Collegiorum tantum Rectoribus
concessum est, cum hac tamen
exceptione, ut conjuges seorsim plerunque
extra Collegia constituant, rariusque
eas intromittant.—De Schismate

do also reject those means which men
presumed they had, whereby they
might be redeemed before God; for
they derogate from the satisfaction of
the Death and Passion of Jesus Christ.
Finally, We hold Purgatory to be none
other than a cheat, which came out of
the same shop: from which also proceeded
monastical vows, pilgrimages,
prohibition of marriage and the use of
meats, a ceremonious observation of
days, auricular confession, indulgences,
and all other such matters, by which
Grace and Salvation may be supposed
to be deserved. Which things we
reject, not only for the false opinion of
merit which was affixed to them, but
also because they are the inventions of
men, and are a yoke laid by their sole
authority upon conscience” (Quick I.

estimating these penalties that they are
expressed in pounds Scots, which were
about one-twelfth of the pound sterling.
These canons, it appears, were not
adopted without opposition. According
to Knox, “But herefrom appealed
the Bishop of Murray and other prelates,
saying That they would abide the
canon law. And so they might well
enough do, so long as they remained
Interpretors, Dispensators, Makers and
Disannullers of the law ” (Op. cit.
119). It was doubtless on some such
considerations that the Archbishop of
St. Andrews relied when he consented
to waive his exemption in this matter.
His personal reputation may be estimated
from the remark of Queen Mary
when, in December, 1566, he performed
the rite of baptism on James VI. She
forbade him to use the popular ceremony
of employing his saliva, giving a
reason which was in the highest degree
derogatory to his moral character (Sir
J. Y. Simpson, in Proceedings of Epidemiological
Society of London, Nov.

Thus the Parliament of 1560, which
effected a settlement of the Reformed
Religion, was urged to its duty by a
Supplication presented in the name of
“The Barons, Gentlemen, Burgesses,
and other true Subjects of this Realm,
professing the Lord Jesus within the
same,” which, among its arguments
against Catholicism, does not hesitate
to assert—“Secondarily, seeing that the
sacraments of Jesus Christ are most
shamefully abused and profaned by
that Romane Harlot and her sworne
vassals, and also because that the true
Discipline of the Ancient Church is
utterly now among that Sect extinguished:
For who within the Realme
are more corrupt in life and manners
than are they that are called the Clergie,
living in whoredom and adultery, deflouring
Virgins, corrupting Matrons,
and doing all abomination without fear
of punishment. We humbly, therefore,

This doctrine bore its full share in
the history of the Scottish reformation.
Two years after the execution of the
protomartyr, Patrick Hamilton, in
1528, his sister Catharine was arraigned
on account of her belief in justification
through Christ. Learned divines urged
upon her with prolix earnestness of
disputation the necessity of works, until
her patience gave way, and she rudely
exclaimed, “Work here and work
there, what kind of working is all this?
No work can save me but the work of
Christ my Saviour.” By the connivance
of the king she was enabled to
escape to England.—Calderwood’s Historie,

Thus the assembly of the church

queen, in which they requested that
“in every Parish some of the Tythes

The orator of the council of Cologne
in 1527, sharply reminded the
assembled prelates that they must set
the example of obeying their own
statutes, and that they could not expect
the people to reverence the true church
so long as it notoriously bade defiance
to the laws of God and man. “Quasi
præscribatur lex cujus sancitor voluerit
esse exlex. Parendum enim est legi
quam quisque sancit.... Audis præterea
non licere plurimas habere uxores,
quæ animum tuum alliciant; non
decere domi alere tot scorta tot Veneres,
quæ te continue exedunt, tuamque
substantiam disperdunt.... His et
aliis datur scandalum populo; præbetur
offendiculum vulgo, cui hac tempestate
vilet et contemptui est ordo quilibet
sacer. Vilis plebs te sacerdotem nunc
cachinnis atque ludibriis incessit et odit,
qui calumniandi ansam ultro præbueris.
Dicit namque: tot hic, aut ille, scorta
domi suæ ex patrimonio Crucifixi nutrit,
quo non sordida scorta, sed pauperes
Christi forent sustentandi”—Concil.
Colon. ann. 1527 (Hartzheim
VI. 210-213).
</p>
<p>
So at the council of Augsburg, in
1548, the orator dwelt upon the advantage
which the heretics derived from
the sins of the clergy—“Non estis
nescii, quemadmodum nos hæretici apud
populum perpetuo traducant: nos scortatores, nos ambitiosos, nos avaros,
nos ignavos, et rudes esse, nos otio
semper, luxui et ventri servire, identidem
vociferantur.... Superbe itaque
illi: sed utinam non nimium sæpe
vere: nam si vera potius hoc loco,
quam plausibilia, dicenda sint; negare
certe non possumus, quin maximam ad
nos accusandos occasionem sæpe dederimus”—Concil.

Alexander III., in prohibiting the

to the emperor that the Council
would not discuss the propositions of
the heretics “nimirum quod judex non
respondet parti, ne ex judice se partem
constituat;” and he is further to explain
that “petentes commune concilium
hæretici et schismatici repellendi sunt
a onciliis universalibus ... nullo
modo commmunicandum esse concilium
cum hæreticis et schismaticis, qui sunt

Twelve years before, his uncle, the
Bishop of Liége, in promulgating the
Augsburg formula of reformation, had
made a similar assertion—“Preterquam

caro corrupit viam suam, præsertimque
ordo clericorum et ecclesiasticorum,
nimium degenerant, plus quam unquam

The increased emphasis of Ferdinand
is a measure of the success which had
attended the reformatory movements of
Charles V. during the interval.
</p>
<p>
In such a condition of ecclesiastical
morality it is no wonder that even in
orthodox Vienna the most popular
theme on which preachers could expatiate
was the corruption of the
church.—See the Emperor Ferdinand’s

Catholic church of Germany had become
widely infected with this Lutheran
heresy is also shown by the
fact that in 1548 the Archbishop of

throughout his province all marriages
of priests, monks, and nuns, and
had pronounced illegitimate the offspring
of such unions.—Hartzheim

<p>
It is observable from this that many
priests left the church and married
without formally embracing the Lutheran
faith, and a return of these was
anticipated from a relaxation of the
canons. Others, as may be gathered
from various references above, married
and still performed their regular duties.
Of these, some no doubt acted in virtue
of dispensations granted by the nuncios
of Paul III., after the promulgation of
the Interim, but many did so in utter
contempt of discipline. An illustrative
example of the latter class may be
found in the well-known Stanislas
Orzechowski, whose marriage, notwithstanding
his prominent position, shows
the laxity of opinion which prevailed
on the subject. As priest and canon
of Przemysl in Poland, his marriage
naturally gave great offence to his colleagues,
which was not diminished by
a dissertation which he wrote in favor
of priestly marriage. This, he subsequently
claimed, had been prepared for
the purpose of laying before the council
of Trent, and its publication had
arisen from the indiscretion of a friend
to whom he had entrusted it. Somewhat
contaminated with the new ideas
by his education at Wittenberg, he
sturdily refused to give up either his wife
or his position. His consequent excommunication
he disregarded, though according
to his own account he gave up
on marrying his benefices and the
ministry (Lettera a Guilio III. trad. di
B. Leoni, Milano, anno. VI.), and notwithstanding
this he had a very narrow
escape from the death-penalty, and his
condemnation excited a commotion
throughout Poland that was very favorable
to the spread of the reformed
opinions (Orichovii Annales, pp. 71-84, 108, Ed. 1854).
At length the feeling
against the pretensions of the church
became so strong that the Diet of 1552
removed all the civil and temporal
penalties of excommunication, so that
he triumphed for the time. When in
1556, the legate Lippomani held a
synod at Lovictz, he called to account
those who had connived at so great an
irregularity. They denied granting
the dispensation, saying that they had
only suspended the censures until the
pleasure of the pope should be known;
but at the same time many prelates
used all their influence with Lippomani
to obtain one. Lippomani declared
that he had no power to grant it, nor
would he do so if he could, seeing that
Orzechowski defended himself on heretical
grounds (Concil. Lovitiens.—Labbei
et Coleti Supp. T. V. p. 702).
In 1561 Orzechowski, in his address to
the synod of Warsaw, admitted that he
had sinned, but claimed that he had
been punished sufficiently—“Si quis
igitur a me quærat; Num uxorem
sacerdos duxerim? Duxisse me fatebor.
Peccasti igitur? Peccavi. Pœnas ergo
peccati debes? Debui et persolvi”
(Doctrina de Sacerd. Cœlibatu, Varsaviæ,
1801). He therefore complained
of the persecutions to which he was
exposed on account of his wife, and he
petitioned both the pope and the council
of Trent for a dispensation. While the
Tridentine fathers refused it, some authors
assert that it was granted by
Pius IV. to him as an exceptional case
“tibi soli Orichovio,” but careful investigation
has failed to discover the Bull,
and, according to Zaccaria the pope
merely sent secret orders to his legate
Commendone not to allow Orzechowski
to be molested, but at the same time to
give no publicity to an act of tolerance
in contravention of the canons of the
council of Trent (Grégoire, Hist du
Mariage des Prêtres en France, pp.
51-55).
</p>
<p>
In his answer to Fricius, Orzechowski
assumes that he was absolved from his
excommunication by the Legate—“Præterea
a sententia excommunicationis,
qua eram a Joanne Episcopo
Premisliensi, ob hanc eandem uxorem,
ex ecclesia pulsus, a Legato Romani
Petri absolutus cum sim, nihil feci
contra ilium” (<i>ap.</i> Doctrin. de Sacerd.
Cœlibat. p. 24). He also alleges the
extraordinary excuse that he abandoned
the priesthood before his marriage.
</p>
<p>
The history of Orzechowski, with
probably a less fortunate result, is no
doubt that of innumerable others,
whose obscurity has prevented their
sufferings from being known beyond
their own narrow circle.
</p>
<p>
Strype (Annals, I. 485-6) asserts
that after the accession of Queen Elizabeth
the Catholic emissaries in England
had a general dispensation to
marry, in order to assist their concealment
and to further the design of creating
schism in the Anglican church.
He gives as his authority one Malachi
Malone, a converted Irish friar.</p></div>

This was not his first attempt of

John Cochlæus to examine the Confession

points were reconcilable with Catholicism

wherein he took strong ground against
abandoning celibacy, but admitted that

In August, 1564, Philip II. had
ordered its publication in the Low
Countries, but Margaret of Parma had
hesitated to obey in consequence of the
intense opposition excited by its interference
with local liberties and franchises,
as it completed and crowned the
centralizing policy which rendered the
papacy supreme over all local churches.
It was not until Dec. 18, 1565, that it
was finally promulgated, under imperative
commands from Philip. It is characteristic
of Philip’s habitual double-dealing,
however, that while his public
orders commanded the reception of the
Council without exception, he secretly
reserved the rights of himself and his
subjects (Le Plat, Concil. Trident. VII.
Præf. p. vi.).</p></div>

By a Bull dated July 18, 1564,
Pius IV. fixed May 1, 1564, as the
time when the Tridentine canons became
the law of the church. His
letter to the Archbishop of Bremen
with an official copy and directions
as to its promulgation, is dated Oct.
3d of the same year (Hartzheim VII.
25).

<p>
It would seem to be a work of supererogation
for a learned Italian lawyer
to write an elaborate treatise, dedicated
to Pius IV., against the abolition of
celibacy, yet Marquardo dei Susani
thought it worth while to do this
in his “Tractatus de Cœlibatu Sacerdotum
non abrogando,” 4to. Venice,
1565.</p></div>

Du Fail, whose high official position
in the Parlement of Rennes precludes
the supposition of any tendency
to Calvinism, devotes one of his discourses
(Contes et Discours d’Eutrapel
No. xx.) to the evils entailed by celibacy
on the church and on society,
quoting the exclamation of Cardinal
Contarini to Velly the French ambassador,
“O quæ mala attulit in ecclesia
cœlibatus ille!” It is true that such
stories as “Frater Fecisti” are not
historical documents, yet they have
their value as indicating the drift of
public feeling and the convictions forced
upon the minds of the people by the
irregularities of the clerical profession.
The same lesson is taught by Boccaccio,
Piers Ploughman, Chaucer, Poggio, the
Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles, and all the
other records of the interior life of the
14th, 15th, and 16th centuries.</p></div>

</p>
<p>
In Spain, by the Carta Acordada of
Aug. 3d, 1629, the Bull of Gregory
XV. was to be referred to in the Edict
of Denunciation; and by the Carta of
Sept. 12th, 1634, a clause was to be
added to the Edict to the effect that
notwithstanding the Bull, the offence
was reserved exclusively to the Inquisition.—Breve
Resumen de las Cartas Acordadas antiquas y modernas, dispuesto
por Abecedario, s. v. Solicitante
(MS. Bib. Reg. Hafniens. No. 218<i>b</i>, p.
264). That the Court of Rome kept
faith in the matter of solicitation would
seem to be proved by a case occurring
in 1695, when Dr. Augustin Velda,
rector of La Sallana in Valencia was
accused before the Inquisition, and fled
to Rome, where he presented himself
to the Sacred Congregation and was
ordered to return. This he did, but
with what result is not noted (Ibid. p.
339). [This exceedingly interesting
MS. is a manual for use in one of the
tribunals of the Spanish Inquisition,
compiled about the year 1670, with notes
bringing it down to the middle of the
18th century. I take this occasion of
expressing my obligations to the gentlemen
in charge of the Royal Library of
Copenhagen, of the Bodleian Library
of Oxford, and of the Royal Library
of Munich, for their courtesy in communicating
to me a number of MSS.]</p></div>

From the latter we learn that a few
years previously the Franciscans of
Bavaria had agreed to receive the Bull
in so far as to prohibit any of their
confessors from absolving a penitent
who had been solicited by those of their
own order, unless she would permit
him to denounce the culprit to the
Superior—an example which the writer
wishes were followed elsewhere, as it
would be very useful in repressing many
scandals which afflicted the German
church.</p></div>

When Grandier was arrested and
tried for sorcery, his papers were seized,
and among them was found an essay
against sacerdotal celibacy. Under
torture, he confessed that he had written
it for the purpose of satisfying the conscience
of a woman with whom he had
maintained marital relations for seven
years (Hist. des Diables de Loudun,
pp. 85, 191). The manuscript was
burnt, with its unlucky author, but a
copy was preserved, which has recently
been printed (Petite Bibliothèque des
Curieux, Paris, 1866). In it, Grandier
shows himself singularly bold for a
man of his time and station. The law
of nature, or moral law, he holds to be
the direct exposition of the Divine will.
By it revealed law must necessarily be
interpreted, and to its standard ecclesiastical
law must be made to conform.
He evidently was made to be burned as
a heretic, if he had escaped as a sorcerer.
The promise of chastity exacted
at ordination he regards as extorted, and
therefore as not binding on those unable
to keep it; while he does not hesitate
to assume that the rule itself was
adopted and enforced on purely temporal
grounds—“de crainte qu’en remuant
une pierre on n’esbranlat la
puissance papale; car hors cette considération
d’Estat, l’Eglise romaine
pense assez que le célibat n’est pas
d’institution divine ni nécessaire au
salut, puisqu’elle en dispense les particuliers,
ce qu’elle ne pourrait faire si
le célibat avoit esté ordonné d’en haut”
(pp. 34-5).</p></div>

Notwithstanding his Sorbonic degree,
Du Pin is said to have been secretly
married, and to have left a
widow, who even ventured to claim the
inheritance of his estate. He was engaged
in a correspondence with William
Wake, Archbishop of Canterbury, with
a view to arrange a basis of reconciliation
of the Anglican Church with
Rome, and, according to Lafitau,
Bishop of Sisteron, in that correspondence
he assented to the propriety of
sacerdotal marriage.</p></div>

I cannot pretend to decide the controversy
as to the alleged marriage between
Bossuet and Mdlle. Desvieux de
Mauléon, nor to determine whether it
is true that she and her daughters
claimed his fortune after his death.
Much has been written on both sides,
and I have not the materials at hand
to justify a positive opinion, though the
extracts from La Baumelle’s “Mémoires
de Madame de Maintenon” given
by the Abbé Chavard (Le Célibat des
Prêtres, pp. 474 sqq.) would seem to
show that there were good grounds for
asserting the marriage. I believe, however,
that there is no doubt of Bossuet
engaging with Leibnitz and Molanus
in a negotiation as to the terms on
which the Lutherans could reënter the
Roman communion, and that he promised,
in the name of the pope, that
Lutheran ministers admitted to the
priesthood or episcopate should retain
their wives. It is asserted that the proposed
arrangement was nearly agreed
to on both sides, when the pretensions
of the House of Hanover to the English
crown caused Leibnitz to withdraw
from the undertaking.</p></div>

This view of the competence of the
temporal power to regulate the question
seems to have been widely received at
this period. An anonymous work published
in 1769 under the title of “Recherches
sur l’État Monastique et Ecclésiastique,”
written by a good Catholic,
asserts (p. 204), “Si le cas de donner
des citoyens à la pàtrie devenoit urgent,
le législateur, en autorisant le mariage
des prêtres, n’entreprendroit rien sur le

Zaccaria, in the introduction to his

that the papal court entertained

but, in considering the question as to
the power or duty of the pope to alter
the law of celibacy (Diss. <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span> cap. 6),
his remarks show clearly that the subject
was discussed in a tone to afford
the partisans of marriage reasonable
grounds for hope. Among the threatening
proceedings of the emperor was
the suppression of no less than 184
monasteries (Lecky, Hist. of Rationalism,

I have not found it easy to form a
satisfactory estimate of the number of
French ecclesiastics previous to the
Revolution. Le Bas (Dictionnaire Encyclopédique
de l’Histoire de France,
V. 218) gives a table, showing an aggregate
of 418,206 souls, of whom
235,147 may be considered as attached
to the secular service, and 183,059 to
the regular orders and canons. Of these
latter, 100,451 were men and 82,608
were women. On the other hand, M.
Sauvestre (Congrégations Religieuses,
pp. 5, 6) quotes from the Abbé Expilly
a statement that in 1765 there were
79,000 monks and 80,000 nuns; while
he shows that other contemporary authorities
reduce the number of members
of religious orders in 1789 to 52,000 of
both sexes. M. Charles Chabot (Encyclopédie
Monastique, p. x., Paris,
1827) computes, after elaborate tabulation,
the number of ecclesiastics, regular
and secular, at 407,753 persons,
enjoying a revenue of 127,610,576
francs.</p></div>

This speech of Portalis <i>père</i> is an
admirable commentary on the Concordat,
developing its causes and consequences
with a rigidity of logic and
an enlightened spirit of faith which
are equally creditable to the head
and heart of the distinguished orator.
From the portion devoted to the subject
of marriage, I quote the following,
as embodying a clear exposition of the
intentions of those who negotiated the
Concordat.
</p>
<p>
“Quelques personnes se plaindront
peut-être de ce que l’on n’a pas conservé
le mariage des prêtres.... En
effet, d’une part nous n’admettons plus
que les ministres dont l’existence est
nécessaire à l’exercice du culte, ce qui
diminue considérablement le nombre
des personnes qui se vouaient anciennement
au célibat. D’autre part, pour
les ministres mêmes que nous conservons,
et à qui le célibat est ordonné
par les réglements ecclésiastiques, la
défense qui leur est faite du mariage
par ces réglements n’est point consacrée
comme <i>empêchement dirimant</i>
dans l’ordre civil: ainsi leur mariage,
s’ils en contractaient un, ne serait
point nul aux yeux des lois politiques
et civiles, et les enfans qui en naîtraient
seraient légitimes; mais dans
le for intérieur et dans l’ordre religieux,
ils s’exposeraient aux peines spirituelles
prononcées par les lois canoniques:
ils continueraient à jouir de leurs droits
de famille et de cité, mais ils seraient
tenus de s’abstenir de l’exercice du
sacerdoce. Conséquemment, sans affaiblir
le nerf de la discipline de l’église,
on conserve aux individus toute la
liberté et tous les avantages garantis
par les lois de l’état; mais il eût été
injuste d’aller plus loin, et d’exiger
pour les ecclésiastiques de France,
comme tels, une exception qui les eût
déconsidérés auprès de tous les peuples
Catholiques, et auprès des Français
mêmes, auxquels ils administreraient
les secours de la religion” (Dupin,
Manuel du Droit Public Ecclés. Français,
4ème éd. pp. 196-8).</p></div>

In an address to the Council of
State, Dec. 20th, 1813, Napoleon said,
“Le sacerdoce est une sorte de mariage;
le prêtre étant uni à l’église comme
l’époux à son épouse, il n’y aurait aucun
inconvénient à appliquer au prêtre
qui se marierait la peine de la bigamie:
un tel ecclésiastique ne mérite aucun
sorte de considération”—Bouhier de
l’Écluse, de l’État des Prêtres en France,
Paris, 1842, p. 17.—Chavard (Le Célibat
des Prêtres, pp. 409-10) quotes
Dean Stanley as asserting, on the authority
of the elder Duc de Broglie,
that Pius VIII. spontaneously offered
to Napoleon to permit sacerdotal marriage,
but that the Emperor declined
the proposal. I cannot but think,
however, that there must be some mistake
in this statement.</p></div>

For many of the above details I
am indebted to the curious but ill-digested
little work—“Histoire du
Mariage des Prêtres en France,” published
by Grégoire in 1826. Grégoire,
though a priest of the <i>ancien régime</i>,
was a sincere and consistent republican.
A member of the States General,
of the Convention, and of the
Council of Five Hundred, elected
Bishop of Blois by the voice of a people
who knew and respected him, he preserved
his ardent faith through all the
excesses of the Revolution, and his
democratic ideas in spite of the injuries
inflicted on his class in the name of the
people. The sincerity and boldness of
his character may be estimated by a
single example. When, on the 7th of
November, 1793, Gobel, Bishop of
Paris, appeared before the Convention
with twelve of his vicars and publicly
renounced his sacred functions on the
ground that hereafter there should be
no other worship than that of liberty
and equality, almost all the ecclesiastics
in the Convention followed his example.
To hold back at such a moment
was dangerous in the extreme, yet Grégoire
had the hardihood to utter a
defiant protest. “I am a Catholic by
conviction and by feeling, a priest by
choice, a bishop by the voice of the
people, but not from the people nor
from you do I derive my mission, and
I will not be forced to an abjuration.”
To him perhaps more than to any one
else is attributable the skilful management
which carried the church through
the storms and persecutions of the
Revolution, but the same inflexibility
which maintained his Catholicism
through the ordeal of 1793 and 1794
caused him to stand by his republicanism
long after it had gone out of
fashion. He was not to be bought or
bullied; the Legitimist was less tolerant
than the Terrorist, and under the
Restoration he was reduced almost to
absolute indigence. Together with the
other constitutional bishops, he had
been compelled to resign his bishopric
by order of the pope after the Concordat
of 1801, and he was too dangerous a
man to be rewarded for his invaluable
services to religion. He died in 1831.</p></div>

Naples was, perhaps, the first kingdom
in Europe to promulgate a civil
marriage law, and to withdraw matrimonial

Yet, to meet the spiritual wants of
all classes, there are still congregations
which practise the most severe ascetic
austerities. Thus, in 1883, a description
of the Barefooted Clares in Paris
shows that, out of eighteen members,
but four are more than twenty-two
years of age, the severity of discipline
causing nearly all who enter to die
young. No fire is allowed, even that
in the kitchen being arranged to prevent
access; sleep is only had on a
narrow board, meat is only eaten on
Christmas Day, and silence is enforced
until some of the nuns lose the power
of forming connected sentences.</p></div>

This regulation, I believe, is still in

are accustomed to renew their engagements
every five years. From the position
taken by Bishop Fabre, of Montreal,
in April, 1883, in the case of a

The comparative strength of the
ecclesiastical militia is an important
element in considering the condition of
the church and its influence on the
laity. I have already quoted statistics
with regard to France, Belgium, and
Austria, and will here append those
for some of the other states and cities of
Europe as given by Prof. von Schulte
in his work on the Newer Catholic
Orders (N. Y. Nation, Aug. 1st, 1872,
p. 75).
</p>
<p>
Prussia, one ecclesiastic for every 584
Catholics, of all ages.
</p>
<p>
Bavaria, one for every 300 Catholics.
</p>
<p>
Germany at large, one for every 481.
</p>
<p>
Aix-la-Chapelle, one for every 110.
</p>
<p>
Cologne, one for every 313.
</p>
<p>
Münster, one for every 61.
</p>
<p>
Trèves, one for every 56.
</p>
<p>
Paderborn, one for every 33.
</p>
<p>
In the old Kingdom of Naples, by
the census of 1842, there were 55,167
ecclesiastics in a population of 6,145,492,
making a proportion of one to 112
(Penka, Uberior Cœlibatus Sacerdotalis

Sauvestre, op. cit. p. 144. It is by
this policy that the church renders itself
responsible for the evil committed by
its members. No human organization
is without its share of the weak or
vicious, and there is no lack of scandals
in the Protestant denominations; but
in these there is a wholesome jealousy
which usually seeks at once to cast out
and punish the offender. Thus, when,
in July, 1867, the Rev. Mr. Wendt, at
an orphan institution near Philadelphia,
was discovered to be tampering
with the virtue of the children under
his charge, those who were most nearly
connected with the management of the
asylum were the first to take steps for
his prosecution, and, as soon as the
necessary legal proceedings could be
had, he was undergoing a sentence of
fifteen years’ solitary confinement, without
a voice being raised in palliation of

One result of this is that there is a
large number of priests, summarily deprived
by their bishops of the ministry,
who seek the great cities to hide their
poverty or find some miserable means
of support. As all requests for dispensation
to marry are refused, they mostly
live in concubinage and their offspring
go to swell the ranks of the dangerous
classes. See Chavard, Le Célibat des
Prêtres, pp. 542-48.</p></div>
